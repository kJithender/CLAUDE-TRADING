- No position below -7% cut threshold: LLY +3.63%, V -0.53%, VST -5.21% ($141.06 > $138.39) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +3.63%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓

- Week of June 8: 2/3 slots used (VST, V). Slot 3 expires unused — deliberate decision ✓
- No new positions today (plan_date 2026-06-11, trades: []) ✓

### No-trade explicit confirmation
No new positions today. Plan date confirmed 2026-06-11. Reasons: (1) LRCX ATR ~11% disqualifies entry; (2) NVDA Senate Banking hearing 10 AM ET creates mid-session AI semi volatility; (3) May PPI at 8:30 AM (already released — need to monitor 10yr for any spike above 4.75%). Slot 3 week of June 8 intentionally expires unused.

### Performance (market-open June 11)
- **Equity:** $98,361.27 (vs last_equity $98,315.05 = +$46.22 = +0.047% today)
- **Today P/L:** LLY -$31.70, V -$24.53, VST +$100.80 = net +$44.57 (Alpaca mark ~+$46.22)

- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.64%** ($100,000 → $98,361.27) vs SPY **-1.99%** (Jun 10 close $724.73 / $739.44 anchor) = **Bull leads SPY by ~+0.35%** ✓

### Stop audit (pre-market June 11)

- LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓

### Position review (pre-market June 11)

**LLY** ($1,135.50 pre-mkt, **+3.84% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **-0.74% today** vs $1,143.94 June 10 close) ⭐ STRONG
- Stop buffer: $1,135.50 − $1,064.457 = **$71.04 (6.26%)** ✓
- Foundayo safety: one liver failure case assessed by Lilly as unlikely drug-related — immaterial. Pipeline acquisitions (~USD 4B) positive. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 in 20 days. Thesis STRONGEST.
- No action.

**V** ($323.75 pre-mkt, **+0.06% from entry $323.57**, **-0.40% today** vs $325.055 June 10 close) ✓ INTACT
- Stop buffer: $323.75 − $292.959 = **$30.79 (9.51%)** ✓
- OpenAI partnership announced — AI agent-driven transactions thesis confirmation. Swipe fee settlement resolved. No action.

**VST** ($141.40 pre-mkt per positions API, **-4.98% from entry $148.81**, **+2.06% today** vs $138.54 June 10 close) ⬆️ RECOVERING
- Official June 10 close was $138.51 — only $0.12 above the -7% cut threshold $138.39 (more critical than the $138.91 I noted at 15:52 ET Wednesday).
- Pre-market recovery to $141.40 provides $3.01 (2.18%) cushion above threshold. Much improved.
- Stop buffer: $141.40 − $135.270 = **$6.13 (4.33%)** ✓
- No VST-specific negative news. Broad market rebound (+0.78% futures) driving recovery. Dividend ex-date June 22 intact. Thesis unchanged.
- **Decision: HOLD. Stop at $135.27 is the defined floor. Midday check required: if VST < $138.39 at 12:30 PM, close per -7% rule.**

### Macro context (pre-market June 11)
- S&P 500 futures: +0.78% — rebounding from Wednesday's -1.67% SPY decline (actual close $724.73)
- May PPI due 8:30 AM ET — potential rate shock if hot (watch: 10yr crossing 4.75%)
- NVDA Senate Banking hearing at 10 AM ET — Huang declined to testify; non-NVDA witnesses only; AI semi sector sentiment uncertain during session
- Iran/US conflict ongoing; WTI ~$88 (<$100 ✓)

### Thesis contract review
- LLY: invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.46) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by July 1. $1,135.50 >> stop. **INTACT. HOLD.**
- V: invalidation = trailing stop fires ($292.96) or regulatory mandate. review_by July 28. $323.75 >> stop. **INTACT. HOLD.**
- VST: invalidation = WTI >$100, FCF cut, PPA cancellation, or breaks $130 on volume. review_by July 7. $141.40 >> $130 invalidation. **INTACT. HOLD.**

### Guardrail checks
- Drawdown circuit breaker: Equity $98,438 vs HWM $101,384 = **-2.91%** — within -10% ✓
- Intraday shock: +$123 = +0.13% vs last_equity — positive ✓
- Cash 75.5% >> 5% minimum ✓
- All trailing stops active (4/4) ✓
- No position below -7% cut threshold (LLY +3.84%, V +0.06%, VST -4.98% pre-mkt) ✓

### New position decision — Slot 3 (week of June 8)

**LRCX: DEFER — ATR disqualifies entry this week.**
- Next earnings: August 5, 2026 ✓
- Q3 2026 results: +24% revenue YoY, EPS +40% YoY, UBS PT $375 — strong fundamentals
- **ATR check:** June 9 range 13.13%, June 10 range 8.91% — 2-day average ~11% >> 3% threshold
- Even halved position: at 11% ATR, a 10% trailing stop provides ~1 average day of cushion. Unacceptable risk profile.
- NVDA hearing during market session creates additional AI semi uncertainty
- **Decision: DEFER to next week. Slot 3 expires unused — deliberate cash decision, not passive default.**

### Cash-drag note (explicit)
Cash 75.5% > strategy target 25-40%. Slot 3 unused. Explicit reasoning: LRCX ATR ~11% disqualifies entry under volatility rule; NVDA hearing outcome unknown until 10 AM; May PPI unknown until 8:30 AM; VST pre-market recovery needs confirmation through the session. NEXT WEEK: LRCX re-evaluation as first priority if ATR normalizes and AI semi sentiment clears.

### Performance (pre-market June 11)
- **Equity:** $98,438.13 (vs last_equity $98,315.05 — +$123.08 overnight = +0.13%)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.69%** ($98,315.05 at June 10 close) vs SPY **-1.99%** ($724.73 at June 10 close) = **Bull LEADS SPY by +0.30%** — first time definitively ahead since inception

## 2026-06-10 15:52 ET — CLOSE — EOD journal

- **Action:** No trades. End-of-day P/L check, exit reconciliation, journal.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 15:50 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $98,374.22 | Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value $24,069.57

### Market context (June 10, 2026)
S&P 500 fell ~1% today (SPY -0.71% to $727.87). Three drivers: (1) May CPI 4.2% YoY — 3-year high but matched expectations; core CPI 2.9% / 0.2% MoM benign; (2) US-Iran military strikes escalating with near-closure of Strait of Hormuz driving oil higher; (3) AI sector extended selloff (NVDA, Micron). VIX +12%. 10yr yield held ~4.54%, below 4.75% trigger. Bull's 75.5% cash posture provided strong protection: Bull -0.45% vs SPY -0.71% = **+0.26% outperformance today**.

### Position review (EOD June 10)

**LLY** ($1,140.49, **+4.29% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **-0.37% today** vs $1,144.68 lastday) ⭐ STRONG
- Both trailing stops (d4147484 7sh, 25989fb5 3sh): HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** — status "new" ✓
- Buffer: $1,140.49 − $1,064.457 = **$76.03 (6.67%)** ✓ Well protected.
- -7% cut threshold: $1,016.99 — remote. No action.

**V** ($323.08, **-0.15% from entry $323.57**, **-0.61% today** vs $325.05 lastday) ✓ WITHIN RANGE
- Trailing stop 66033918: HWM $325.51, stop **$292.959** — status "new" ✓
- Buffer: $323.08 − $292.959 = **$30.12 (9.32%)** ✓ Healthy.
- Day 1 close essentially flat from entry — mild market-correlated weakness. Payments thesis intact. No action.

**VST** ($138.91, **-6.65% from entry $148.81**, **-5.00% today** vs $146.22 lastday) ⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL
- Trailing stop c4c200a5: HWM **$150.30**, stop **$135.270** — status "new" ✓
- Buffer: $138.91 − $135.270 = **$3.64 (2.62%)** ⚠️ Critically thin.
- **-7% cut threshold: $138.39 — VST closed only $0.52 above it.** Fell -5.00% today.
- No specific VST catalyst — Iran/oil macro pressure + broad market selloff. Nuclear PPAs with Meta + AWS intact. Dividend ex-date June 22 in 12 days (USD 9.16 credit for 40sh).
- **Close routine does NOT cut. -7% rule applies at Thursday midday. Stop at $135.27 is the defined exit floor. Pre-market Thursday: HIGHEST PRIORITY CHECK.**

### Exit reconciliation
- **META** exited today via trailing stop at $578.00 (11:06 AM ET). Post-mortem in closed-trades.md ✓; lesson in lessons.md ✓ (recorded at midday). Ledger current.
- **V buy** executed at market-open today (22sh @ $323.57, order 4d966b86). Trailing stop 66033918 confirmed ✓.
- All other active positions (LLY, V, VST) unchanged vs midday.

### Guardrail checks (EOD June 10)
- No position below -7% cut threshold: LLY +4.29%, V -0.15%, VST -6.65% ($138.91 > $138.39) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold ✓
- Drawdown circuit breaker: Equity $98,374 vs HWM $101,384 = **-2.97%** — well within -10% ✓
- Intraday shock: -$443.42 = -0.45% — below -4% threshold ✓
- Active trailing stops (all 4 confirmed via live Alpaca orders):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - V (66033918): 22sh — HWM **$325.51**, stop **$292.959** ✓
  - VST (c4c200a5): 40sh — HWM **$150.30**, stop **$135.270** ✓
  - ~~META (4ea07e91)~~: **FILLED** $578.00 ✓
- Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- Week of June 8: 2/3 slots used (VST June 9, V June 10). Slot 3 (LRCX) deferred pending NVDA hearing June 11 ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (EOD June 10)
- **Equity:** $98,374.22 (vs last_equity $98,817.64 = -$443.42 today = -0.45%)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY -$41.90, V -$10.78, VST -$292.40, META realized vs prior mark ~-$98 = net ~-$443 ✓
- **Cash:** $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value: $24,069.57
- **SPY today:** $727.87 (vs $733.06 Jun 9 close = -0.71%) — **Bull outperformed SPY by +0.26%**
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.63%** ($100,000 → $98,374.22) vs SPY **-1.57%** ($739.44 → $727.87) = **-0.07% gap** — NEAR PAR, best result since inception

### Notes
- Today was another broad-market down day. Bull's 75.5% cash posture provided real protection: outperforming SPY by +0.26% and narrowing the since-inception gap to just -0.07%. Third consecutive demonstration of the cash cushion (Jun 5, Jun 9, Jun 10).
- **The since-inception gap is now essentially at par (-0.07%).** Despite 5 realized losses totaling ~-$1,689, LLY's +4.29% unrealized gain and cash cushion have held near-parity with SPY.
- **VST is the immediate risk Thursday.** At $138.91 with -7% threshold $138.39, only $0.52 of cushion remains. Iran/oil escalation is the culprit, not a VST-specific catalyst. Stop at $135.27 is the defined exit floor. Do NOT pre-empt unless -7% rule is breached at Thursday midday.
- NVDA Senate Banking hearing June 11 (tomorrow) — watching for AI semi sentiment; affects LRCX slot 3 decision.
- Race: Bull -1.63% | AGGRO ~-6.16% (midday est.) | SPY -1.57% — Bull leads AGGRO by ~4.5pp.

## 2026-06-10 12:34 ET — MIDDAY CHECK — META trailing stop filled; VST near -7% threshold

- **Action:** No manual trades. META trailing stop auto-executed 11:06 AM ET. Stop audit passed. VST on high alert.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 12:34 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $98,428.62 | Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value $24,123.97

### META — EXIT via trailing stop (auto-executed 11:06 AM ET)
- **Action:** SELL 15 shares META (trailing stop order 4ea07e91, filled 11:06 AM ET June 10)
- **Fill:** 15 shares @ $578.00 avg (confirmed in filled orders)
- **Why:** Trailing stop HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 triggered on continued broad market weakness. META has drifted lower since June 5 NFP shock and never recovered to HWM. Stop auto-executed at $578.00.
- **P/L from entry:** 15sh × ($578.00 − $620.637) = **−$639.56 (−6.87%)** from entry.
- **Verified:** META absent from positions ✓. Stop order 4ea07e91 shows status "filled" at $578.00 ✓. No orphaned orders for META.

### Shock check
- Equity $98,428.62 vs last_equity $98,817.64 = −$389.02 = **−0.39%** today — well below −4% threshold ✓ No shock day.

### Position review (12:34 ET)

**LLY** ($1,147.77, **+4.96% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+0.27% today** vs $1,144.68 lastday) ⭐ STRONG
- Both trailing stops (d4147484 7sh, 25989fb5 3sh): HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $1,147.77 − $1,064.457 = **$83.31 (7.26%)** ✓ Well protected.
- −7% cut threshold: $1,016.99 — CLEAR. Tighten (+15%) threshold: $1,257.56 — NOT triggered.

- Trailing stop 66033918: HWM $325.51, stop **$292.959** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $321.085 − $292.959 = **$28.13 (8.75%)** ✓ Adequate.
- −7% cut threshold: $300.92 — CLEAR. Tighten (+15%) threshold: $372.11 — NOT triggered.
- No action. New position (day 1); mild softness is market-correlated.

**VST** ($139.56, **−6.22% from entry $148.81**, **−4.56% today** vs $146.22 lastday) ⚠️ HIGH WATCH
- Trailing stop c4c200a5: HWM **$150.30**, stop **$135.270** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $139.56 − $135.270 = **$4.29 (3.08%)** ⚠️ Thin.
- −7% cut threshold: **$138.39** — VST is only **$1.17 above it**.
- Live news scan: No VST-specific negative catalyst found. Decline appears broad-market correlated. Nuclear PPA thesis with Meta + AWS unchanged. Q1 adj EBITDA +20% YoY confirmed. Dividend ex-date June 22 intact.
- **Decision: HOLD. Thesis intact. Stop active. −7% rule has NOT been breached ($139.56 > $138.39). Do NOT cut manually — let stop manage exit if deterioration continues. If VST closes below $138.39 or touches $135.27 stop, exit will be automatic.**
- Tighten (+15%) threshold: $171.13 — NOT triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:34 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold: LLY +4.96%, V −0.77%, VST −6.22% ($1.17 above threshold) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold ✓
- Drawdown circuit breaker: Equity $98,429 vs HWM $101,384 = **−2.53%** — well within −10% limit ✓
- Active trailing stops (all 3 confirmed via live Alpaca orders):

  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - V (66033918): 22sh — HWM **$325.51**, stop **$292.959** ✓
  - VST (c4c200a5): 40sh — HWM **$150.30**, stop **$135.270** ✓
  - ~~META (4ea07e91)~~: **FILLED** $578.00 ✓
- Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $98,428.62 (vs last_equity $98,817.64 = −$389.02 today = −0.39%)
- **Today P/L:** META stop fill impact (realized −$639.56 vs yesterday mark); LLY +$30.90 intraday, V −$54.67 intraday, VST −$266.40 intraday
- **Cash:** $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value: $24,123.97
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−1.57%** ($100K → $98,428.62)
- **Week of June 8:** 2/3 positions used (VST June 9, V June 10). 1 slot remaining (LRCX deferred — NVDA hearing today June 11 pending).

### Notes
- META trailing stop filled cleanly at $578 this morning. Thesis was intact (AI ad moat, enterprise agents) but the price never recovered to HWM after the June 5 NFP shock. The stop did its job — no manual intervention was appropriate at any point. Post-mortem logged in closed-trades.md; lesson logged in lessons.md.
- VST is the immediate risk. At $139.56 with the −7% threshold at $138.39, only $1.17 of cushion remains. No specific catalyst found — broad market weakness is the culprit. The thesis (nuclear PPAs with Meta + AWS, AI power demand secular tailwind) is unchanged. The stop at $135.27 provides a defined exit floor. DO NOT pre-empt the stop unless the −7% rule is breached at midday. If VST holds $138.39 through close, no action. If it breaches $138.39 before close: close immediately.
- Portfolio now has 3 positions (LLY, V, VST) with 75.5% cash. LLY remains the standout (+4.96%). The high-cash posture is again providing relative protection on a down market day.

- **Why (Slot 2 of 3, week of June 8):** Payments infrastructure compounder. Q2 FY26 net revenue +17% YoY; non-GAAP EPS $3.31 beat; $20B buyback authorized. CFO Chris Suh's May 12 sale confirmed via SEC filing as pre-arranged 10b5-1 plan (NOT discretionary) — the blocker that deferred V for 2 weeks is resolved. V trading at/above CFO's 10b5-1 sale price ($323.57 vs $324.88 CFO sale) — constructive. 5-of-5 entry signals met. Adds Financials sector diversification. CPI 4.2% (≤4.2% threshold met ✓), 10yr 4.54% (<4.75% ✓), V opened $326.62 (within $310-$340 ✓), SPY -0.38% (<-1.5% ✓). All conditions met.

- Trailing stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop **$578.142** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $587.045 − $578.142 = **$8.90 (1.52%)** ⚠️ VERY THIN — persistent concern.
- −7% cut threshold: $577.19 — META is $9.86 above it. NOT triggered.
- Recovering slightly today (+0.28%) from June 8 close $585.39. AI ad thesis intact.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered.

**VST** ($143.37, **−3.66% from entry $148.81**, **−2.40% today** vs $146.90 lastday) ✓ WITHIN RANGE
- Trailing stop c4c200a5: HWM **$150.30** (ratcheted from $148.40 — VST hit $150.30 post-open), stop **$135.27** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $143.37 − $135.27 = **$8.10 (5.65%)** ✓ Adequate.
- −7% cut threshold: $138.39 — VST at $143.37 is $5.00 above it. NOT triggered.
- +15% tighten threshold: $171.13 — not triggered.
- VST down −2.40% today likely due to broader market pressure. Nuclear power thesis unchanged; PPAs with Meta + AWS intact. Stop provides defined exit.

### Guardrail checks (12:34 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +4.62%, META −5.41%, VST −3.66%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via live Alpaca orders:
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ Very thin buffer
  - VST (c4c200a5): HWM **$150.30** (ratcheted), stop **$135.27** ✓
- Cash $72,753.20 (73.7%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $98,734.63 (vs last_equity $98,977.95 = −$243.32 today)
- **Today P/L:** LLY −$50.70, META +$24.83, VST −$217.60 = net −$243.47 (−0.25%)
- **Cash:** $72,753.20 (73.7%) | Long market value: $25,981.43
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −1.27% ($100K → $98,734.63). SPY: est ~$747 area. Gap ~−2.03% est (SPY rebounding strongly, Bull with 73% cash has less exposure to the recovery).

### Notes
- Market quiet at midday — no guardrail triggers. All three positions within acceptable ranges.
- META remains the primary risk. At $587.045 with stop $578.142, the buffer is only 1.52% ($8.90). This has been a persistent concern since June 5. The trailing stop is doing its job — it will fire automatically if breached. Do NOT intervene manually. The AI ad thesis remains intact (enterprise AI agent launch, BofA Buy, $856 target). The price weakness is a macro hangover from June 5 NFP shock, not a thesis break.
- VST's HWM ratcheted to $150.30 (stock cleared $150 post-open before pulling back). Stop now at $135.27 (10% below $150.30). Today's −2.40% move is market-related; nuclear PPAs with Meta/AWS are unchanged. Buffer 5.65% remains adequate.
- LLY pulled back modestly (−0.44%) from yesterday's close ($1,149.15 → $1,144.08). Still well above entry (+4.62%). Stop buffer 6.96%. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 catalyst still 22 days away. No action.
- No new positions at midday per playbook.

## 2026-06-09 09:37 ET — MARKET OPEN — BUY VST 40 shares (Slot 1 of 3)

- **Why (Slot 1 of 3, week of June 8):** Nuclear power operator with locked 20-year PPAs with Meta + Amazon for AI data-center baseload electricity. Secular AI power demand story — VST owns contracted nuclear capacity to reliably power hyperscaler data centers. Q1 adj EBITDA +20% YoY. $220+ analyst consensus target (49%+ upside at $148.81). Non-correlated to AI semi volatility — portfolio diversification benefit. VST opened $148.73 (≥$145 condition met). 4 of 5 entry signals met (technical below 50-day SMA is the miss; noted caution).
- **Stop (40 shares):** 10% trailing stop placed (order id: c4c200a5-b5fb-454d-bd7e-77ece5909810) — HWM $148.40 (ratcheted from initial $148.01), stop $133.56, GTC exp 2026-09-04

### All trailing stops (09:37 ET — 4 active, all confirmed via Alpaca orders)

- **VST** ($148.38, **−0.29% from entry $148.81**, **+1.01% today** vs $146.90 last close) NEW ✓ — Vistra Energy nuclear operator. 20-yr PPAs with Meta + AWS. AI power demand secular tailwind. Trailing stop c4c200a5 active (HWM $148.40, stop $133.56, 10.1% buffer from stop).
- **LLY** ($1,165.09, **+6.54% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+1.39% today**) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL — Both stops (d4147484, 25989fb5): HWM $1,182.73, stop $1,064.457. Buffer: $100.63 (8.64%) ✓. LLY approaching HWM from below ($17.64 away = 1.51%). Retatrutide Phase 3 data strongly positive.
- **META** ($592.54, **−4.53% from entry $620.637**, **+1.22% today**) ✓ RECOVERING — Stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop $578.142. Buffer: $14.40 (2.43%) ✓ improving. Enterprise AI agent launch positive. −7% threshold $577.19 — $15.35 above it ✓.

### Performance (09:37 ET)

- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.78% ($100K → $99,222.15). SPY ~$747 est (+1.04% from Jun 8 close $739.30). **Gap: ~−1.82% est** (widens mechanically as SPY gaps up on rebound; cash drag; gap narrows as VST + further positions compound).
- **Week of June 8:** 1/3 positions used (VST June 9). 2 slots remaining.

### Notes
- VST buy executed cleanly. Opened $148.73, filled at $148.81 avg (reasonable $0.08 slippage). Trailing stop at $133.56 (10% below HWM $148.40) provides defined exit risk.
- LLY approaching its all-time portfolio HWM ($1,182.73) — only $17.64 away. If LLY breaks above today, both stops ratchet higher. Retatrutide Phase 3 data from ADA is fresh bullish fuel. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 is 22 days away.
- META recovering (+1.22% today) from the June 5 NFP shock. Stop buffer improved from pre-market $13.88 to $14.40. No action needed.
- No further trades planned today. V and LRCX remain deferred. 2 slots available for Wednesday/Thursday.

- Stop buffer: $1,148.91 − $1,064.457 = **$84.45 (7.35%)** ✓ Well protected.
- Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 now 23 days away. Thesis strongest in portfolio.

**META** ($588.445, **−5.19% from entry $620.637**, **−0.77% today** vs $593.00 lastday close) ⚠️ WATCH
- Trailing stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop **$578.142** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $588.445 − $578.142 = **$10.30 (1.75%)** ⚠️ Narrow — unchanged critical concern from morning.
- Cut threshold: $577.19 (−7%) — META $11.26 above it. NOT triggered.
- SPY opened +0.55% ($743.36) and faded to close $739.30; META tracked the fade. No company-specific news.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered. Tuesday open is critical.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.06%, META −5.19%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY +5.06%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓

- No new positions today — WTI oil elevated + no clean setups ✓
- Week of June 8: 0/3 new-position slots used ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### SPY performance
- **SPY today (June 8):** Opened $743.36, closed $739.30 — **−0.55% from open**; essentially **+0.005% from Friday close** ($739.265 → $739.30)
- Since inception SPY $739.44 → $739.30 = **−0.02%**

### Performance (EOD June 8)
- **Equity:** $99,019.89 (up from last_equity $98,853.30)
- **Today P/L:** +$166.59 (+0.17%)
  - LLY intraday: +$174.90 (+$17.49/sh × 10sh)
  - META intraday: −$68.33 (−$4.555/sh × 15sh)
  - Net intraday unrealized: +$106.57; remainder from account mark adjustments
- **SPY today:** essentially flat (+0.005% from Friday close); opened strongly +0.55% then faded all session
- **Bull outperformed SPY today by +0.17%** — modest outperformance as SPY intraday faded
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.98% ($100K → $99,019.89) vs SPY −0.02% ($739.44 → $739.30) = **−0.96% gap** (improved from −1.06% at June 5 close; gap narrowed by +0.10%)

### Notes
- SPY had a deceptive session: gapped up to $743.36 (+0.55%) at open, then faded all day to close at $739.30, essentially flat from Friday. The intraday fade reflected continued Iran/Israel geopolitical caution and risk-off pressure persisting from the June 5 NFP shock.
- LLY closed at $1,148.91 (+1.55%). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 imminent (23 days). Both trailing stops healthy at 7.35% buffer. No action needed.
- META is the key risk overnight. Stop at $578.142 is only $10.30 (1.75%) away. The position has drifted lower each day since June 5 NFP shock. AI ad thesis intact but price action is not confirming. If broad market continues weak Tuesday, the stop will fire — this is the stop doing its job, do NOT override manually.
- No new positions — correct decision. WTI oil $93.67 at pre-market (Iran/Israel). Week of June 8: 0/3 slots used. Research priority Tuesday/Wednesday: V (Visa CFO selling resolution), VST (Vistra once WTI direction clarifies), LRCX (once basing action confirms).

- **Action:** None — all positions within guardrail thresholds. No cuts, no stop tightening.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 12:35 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $99,115.29 | Cash $78,705.60 (79.4%) | Long market value $20,409.69

### Position review (12:35 ET)

**LLY** ($1,158.69, **+5.96% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.41% today** vs $1,131.42 lastday) ✓ STRONG
- Both trailing stops auto-ratcheted since market-open: HWM now **$1,182.73** (up from $1,173.23 at open), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
- LLY must have hit $1,182.73+ intraday today, setting a new all-time portfolio HWM. Excellent.
- Cut threshold: $1,016.99 (−7%) — remote. No action.
- Tighten threshold: $1,257.56 (+15%) — not yet reached (+5.96%). No action.
- Stop buffer: $1,158.69 − $1,064.457 = **$94.23 (8.13%)** ✓ Well protected.

**META** ($588.10, **−5.24% from entry $620.637**, **−0.83% today** vs $593.00 lastday) ⚠️ WATCH
- Trailing stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop **$578.142** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $588.10 − $578.142 = **$9.96 (1.69%)** ⚠️ Narrow — same concern as market-open.
- Cut threshold: $577.19 (−7%) — META $10.91 above it. NOT triggered.
- META drifted down −0.83% today from $593 close. AI ad thesis intact; no news-driven selloff.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:35 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.96%, META −5.24%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY +5.96%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via live Alpaca orders:
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73** (**RATCHETED further** from $1,173.23), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73** (**RATCHETED**), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ Narrow buffer
- Cash $78,705.60 (79.4%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:35 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,115.29 (vs open $99,057.34 = +$57.95 today)
- **Today P/L:** +$57.95 (+0.06%) — LLY +$272.70 intraday, META −$73.50 intraday = net ~+$199 (Alpaca unrealized intraday); balance likely account-mark timing
- **Cash:** $78,705.60 (79.4%) | Long market value: $20,409.69
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.89% ($100K → $99,115.29). SPY: estimated ~$742 area. Gap ~−1.35% (estimate).

### Notes
- LLY continues to strengthen. The automatic stop ratchet to HWM $1,182.73 (from $1,173.23 at open) means LLY set a new all-time portfolio high intraday. The floor is now $1,064.457 — a 10% cushion below the HWM, and still well above avg entry $1,093.534. LLY at $1,158.69 is 8.13% above its stop. Thesis triple-confirmed: Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 imminent.
- META remains the concern. At $588.10 with stop $578.142, the buffer is only 1.69% ($9.96). The −7% cut threshold $577.19 is essentially co-located with the stop. Any continuation downward will trigger the stop automatically. AI ad thesis is still intact but price action is not confirming it. Geopolitical risk (Iran/Israel, WTI elevated) continues to weigh on the broad market.
- WTI oil: still monitoring — no new position data available at midday but pre-market was $93.67. No new positions today regardless.
- No action taken. System is managing risk correctly via trailing stops.

## 2026-06-08 09:37 ET — MARKET OPEN (no trades)
- **Action:** None — no new positions. Pre-market plan: no trades due to WTI at $93.67 (approaching $100 halt trigger). Plan is CURRENT (dated today June 8, 2026).
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 09:36 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $99,057.34 | Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) | Long market value $20,351.74

### Position review (09:37 ET)

**LLY** ($1,161.52, **+6.22% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.54% today** vs June 5 close $1,132.80) ⭐ EXCELLENT
- LLY hit intraday high **$1,171.865** today — **CLEARED the prior HWM of $1,166.29**.
- Both trailing stops (d4147484 and 25989fb5) **auto-ratcheted** to new HWM:
  - Old: HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661
  - **New: HWM $1,173.23, stop $1,055.907** (confirmed via live Alpaca orders) ✓
- Thesis triple-confirmed: Eli Lilly hit $1.01T market cap, Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1, all 3 PBMs covering. Strong upward momentum.
- No action — let stops ratchet with price. ✓

**META** ($583.775, **−6.10% from entry $620.637**, **−1.52% today** vs June 5 close $592.85) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Intraday low: $579.23** — came within **$1.08 of triggering the $578.142 stop**.
- Current buffer from stop: $583.775 − $578.142 = **$5.63 (0.97%)** — EXTREMELY THIN.
- −7% cut threshold: $577.19 (entry $620.637 × 0.93). Not breached — META at $583.775 is $6.56 above it.
- Thesis intact: AI ad moat, Q1 +33% revenue. Selloff appears to be broad-market/geopolitical (Iran/Israel), not META-specific.
- **No manual action.** Stop at $578.142 is active and will fire automatically if hit. This is the stop doing its job. DO NOT intervene before the midday check.
- If META is still in this range at 12:30 PM midday check: close immediately if price < $577.19 per −7% rule.

### Guardrail checks (09:37 ET)
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +6.22%, threshold $1,257.26) ✓
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +6.22%, META −6.10%) ✓ — META close but not triggered
- Active trailing stops (all 3 confirmed via live Alpaca orders):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,173.23** (**RATCHETED** from $1,166.29), stop **$1,055.907** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,173.23** (**RATCHETED** from $1,166.29), stop **$1,055.907** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ NARROW BUFFER
- Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- New positions this week: 0/3 ✓
- WTI oil ~$93.67 — approaching $100 halt trigger → NO NEW POSITIONS ✓

### Performance (09:37 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,057.34 (vs last_equity $98,853.30) — up +$204.04 from Friday EOD
- **Today P/L:** +$204.04 (+0.21%) — LLY +$273.85 intraday, META −$141.75 intraday (per Alpaca unrealized_intraday_pl) = net +$132.10; remainder likely from account mark timing
- **Cash:** $78,705.60 (79.5%) | Long market value: $20,351.74
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.95% ($100K → $99,057.34). SPY: ~$742.81 (pre-mkt was +0.73% from June 5 close $737.45 = ~$742.81 estimated at open). SPY since inception: $739.44 → ~$742.81 = +0.46%. **Gap: −1.41%** (estimate).

### Notes
- Iran/Israel geopolitical escalation is the dominant macro risk today. WTI at $93.67 (+3.46%) was the basis for no new positions, per pre-market plan. No new positions is the correct decision.
- LLY is the portfolio standout. The stop ratchet to HWM $1,173.23 locks in a $1,055.907 floor (−3.60% from avg entry $1,093.534). LLY is now above entry by 6.22% with a floor well above entry — excellent risk management by design.
- META is on high alert. The $1.08 intraday gap between the low ($579.23) and the stop ($578.142) was extremely narrow. The broad-market Iran/geopolitical selloff is what's driving META lower. If today ends without the stop firing, meta will need close monitoring at midday (12:30 PM) and the −7% rule will be the governing threshold.
- Week of June 8: 0/3 new-position slots used. Next new-position consideration deferred to Tuesday/Wednesday pending WTI stabilization.

## 2026-06-05 15:54 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal. Market open confirmed `is_open: true` (closes 16:00 ET).
- **Account:** Equity $98,916.92 | Cash $78,705.62 (79.6%) | Long market value $20,211.30

### Position review (EOD June 5)
- **LLY** ($1,133.88, **+3.69% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+0.77% today** [+$8.61/sh]) — Pulled back from today's intraday HWM $1,166.29 but closed constructively. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact. Stop buffer: $1,133.88 − $1,049.661 = $84.22 (7.43%). Stops unchanged (LLY closed below HWM today — no further ratchet after midday).
- **META** ($591.51, **−4.69% from entry $620.637**, **−5.75% today** [−$36.06/sh]) ⚠️ WATCH — Major selloff today. Broad market risk-off drove META down sharply. Stop $578.142 — only $13.37 buffer (2.26%). −7% cut threshold $577.19 — META is $14.32 above it. AI ad thesis intact; this appears to be macro-driven (SPY −2.41% today), not a META-specific thesis break. If META opens below $582 on Monday, treat as very high alert.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +3.69%, META −4.69%, threshold −7.00%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +3.69%) ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via Alpaca orders:
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661, status "new" ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661, status "new" ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142, status "new" ✓ ⚠️ Narrow buffer
- Cash $78,705.62 (79.6%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- Week of June 1: 2/3 new-position slots used. Slot 3 (V/Visa) deferred to next week ✓
- No new positions at close ✓

### SPY performance
- **SPY today (June 5):** Opened $752.31, closed $739.265 — **−2.41%** from June 4 close $757.55.
  (Also opened at gap-down vs prior close: $757.55 → $752.31 gap = −0.69%; then fell further intraday −1.73%)
- Since inception SPY $739.44 → $739.265 = **−0.02%**

### Performance (EOD June 5)
- **Equity:** $98,916.92 (down from last_equity $99,883.06)
- **Today P/L:** −$966.14 (−0.97%) — detailed: LLY +$86.10, META −$540.90, NVDA realized vs June 4 close −$306.54, MSFT realized vs June 4 close −$164.74 = ~−$926 (close to actual −$966 with minor rounding/timing differences)
- **SPY today:** −2.41% ($757.55 → $739.265)
- **Bull outperformed SPY today by +1.44%** — high cash protected against the market selloff
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −1.08% ($100K → $98,916.92) vs SPY −0.02% ($739.44 → $739.265) = **−1.06% gap** (massively improved from −3.08% at midday; SPY's −2.41% selloff closed the gap)

### Notes
- Today was a significant down day for US equities. SPY fell −2.41% — likely driven by the strong NFP print (172K vs 85–125K consensus) pushing rate-cut expectations further out, combined with pre-existing market weakness.
- Bull's 79% cash position provided substantial downside protection. The high-cash posture, which lagged in the bull run from inception through June 3, paid off today.
- NVDA and MSFT trailing stops that triggered at midday protected against further losses: NVDA closed around $209 area (consistent with stop fill), MSFT similarly. Both would have fallen further in the afternoon session given the market selloff.
- META is the key risk going into next week. At $591.51 with a stop at $578.142 (2.26% buffer), any continued market weakness Monday morning could trigger the stop. The −7% cut threshold ($577.19) is essentially co-located with the stop. At pre-market on Monday, close attention required.
- LLY held up better than the market today (+0.77% vs SPY −2.41%). GLP-1 thesis and July 1 catalyst are holding.
- Week of June 1 final tally: 2/3 slots used (META June 1, LLY +3sh June 5). All 4 exits (AMZN −7.39%, AVGO −2.1%, NVDA −3.36%, MSFT −0.70%) were via guardrails — no discretionary selling. Capital preserved correctly.
- **Weekly review runs at 4:30 PM ET today (Friday June 5).**

## 2026-06-05 12:33 ET — MIDDAY CHECK — NVDA and MSFT trailing stops triggered (no manual action)

- **Action:** None — no manual action. Two trailing stops (NVDA, MSFT) executed automatically earlier in the session. Remaining 2 positions (LLY, META) within guardrail thresholds.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 12:33 ET — next close 16:00 ET June 5)
- **Account:** Equity $99,370.92 | Cash $78,705.62 (79.2%) | Long market value $20,665.30

### NVDA — EXIT via trailing stop (auto-executed 11:20 AM ET)
- **Action:** SELL 30 shares NVDA (trailing stop order 8c6b9680, filled 11:20 AM ET)
- **Fill:** 30 shares @ $209.042 avg (filled ~11:20 AM ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** NVDA stop (HWM $232.28, stop $209.052) triggered on intraday decline. At market-open NVDA was at $213.50 with only $4.45 buffer (2.1%) — flagged as ⚠️ watch at the open routine. Senator Warren Senate Banking hearing June 11 regulatory noise continued to weigh. Stop filled near the trigger level ($209.042 vs $209.052 stop — essentially at stop price, no meaningful gap).
- **P/L from entry:** 30sh × ($209.042 − $216.302) = **−$217.80 (−3.36%)** from entry. Thesis was intact but the price never recovered above entry after the AVGO sympathy selling June 4.
- **Verified:** NVDA absent from positions ✓. Stop order 8c6b9680 shows status "filled" at $209.042 ✓. No orphaned orders for NVDA.

### MSFT — EXIT via trailing stop (auto-executed 12:08 PM ET)
- **Action:** SELL 20 shares MSFT (trailing stop order a55a3db6, filled ~12:08 PM ET)
- **Fill:** 20 shares @ $419.363 avg (filled ~12:08 PM ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** MSFT stop (HWM $466.32, stop $419.688) triggered on intraday decline. At market-open MSFT was at $427.67 with only $7.98 buffer (1.9%) — flagged as ⚠️ narrow. The stock had been under pressure since the Build conference "sell the news" pattern and deteriorated further today. Stop filled slightly below the $419.688 trigger level ($419.363 — small gap of $0.325).
- **P/L from entry:** 20sh × ($419.363 − $422.31) = **−$58.94 (−0.70%)** from entry. Azure AI thesis was intact but price action failed to recover from the post-Build pullback.
- **Verified:** MSFT absent from positions ✓. Stop order a55a3db6 shows status "filled" at $419.363 ✓. No orphaned orders for MSFT.

### Remaining position review (12:33 ET)
- **LLY** ($1,153.41, **+5.48% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.50% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST position. LLY set new HWM $1,166.29 today; both stops auto-ratcheted (d4147484 + 25989fb5, each HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact. Tighten threshold at $1,257.56 (+15%) — not triggered. Cut threshold $1,016.99 (−7%) — remote. **No action.**
- **META** ($608.71, **−1.92% from entry $620.637**, **−3.00% today**) ✓ — Weaker today. Stop $578.142 ($30.57 buffer, 4.7% from current price). Cut threshold $577.19 — safely above it. AI ad thesis intact. **No action.**

### Guardrail checks (12:33 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.48%, META −1.92%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +5.48%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓
- Active trailing stops (all confirmed):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,166.29** (auto-ratcheted — new HWM!), stop **$1,049.661** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,166.29** (auto-ratcheted), stop **$1,049.661** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM today)
  - ~~NVDA (8c6b9680)~~: **FILLED** at $209.042 ✓
  - ~~MSFT (a55a3db6)~~: **FILLED** at $419.363 ✓
- Cash $78,705.62 (79.2%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders for exited positions ✓

### Performance (12:33 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,370.92 (down from $99,883.06 last_equity)
- **Today P/L:** −$512.14 (−0.51%) — NVDA stop exit −$217.80, MSFT stop exit −$58.94, LLY +$281.40 intraday, META −$282.90 intraday = net ~−$278 realized + ~−$1.50 unrealized
- **Cash:** $78,705.62 (79.2%) | Long market value: $20,665.30
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.63% ($100K → $99,370.92) vs SPY ~+2.45% est = **~−3.08% gap** (wider; NVDA and MSFT exits locked in losses)

### Notes
- Both NVDA and MSFT had been flagged with narrow stop buffers at the market-open routine today (NVDA 2.1% buffer, MSFT 1.9% buffer). Both stopped out as the session progressed — this is exactly how the trailing stop protection is meant to work. No manual intervention was appropriate.
- NVDA never recovered above entry ($216.302) after the AVGO sympathy selling on June 4. Senator Warren hearing June 11 added regulatory overhang. With only $4.45 buffer at open, a modest down day was sufficient to trigger.
- MSFT had been under pressure since the Build conference "sell the news" pattern. The stock never returned to its May highs ($466.32 HWM). The narrow $7.98 buffer did not survive today's weakness.
- Portfolio now concentrated in 2 positions (LLY + META) + 79% cash. This is correct — exited positions via guardrails, not thesis breaks. Capital is preserved for future deployment.
- **Week of June 1 new-position count: 2/3 (META June 1 slot 1; LLY scale-up June 5 slot 2). Slot 3 remains.**
- NVDA and MSFT exits do NOT consume weekly new-position slots (exits are not new positions).
- Next consideration: research new candidates for next week (week of June 8). V (Visa) — CFO insider selling concern still unresolved, defer research to next week.

## 2026-06-05 09:38 ET — MARKET OPEN — BUY LLY +3 shares (scale-up, Slot 2)
- **Action:** BUY 3 shares LLY (market order, whole shares for trailing-stop eligibility)
- **Fill:** 3 shares @ avg $1,141.58 (order id: 376f7a4d-8e7c-4430-a427-2050ec1d219d) — paper trading partial fills: 2sh @ $1,141.02 (09:38 ET), 1sh @ ~$1,142.70 (09:40 ET). Total position now 10 shares, avg entry $1,093.534.
- **Why (Slot 2 of 3, week of June 1):** GLP-1 franchise dominance is strengthening: Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 Bridge program effective July 1 expanding access to ~20–30M beneficiaries; all three major PBMs covering full Lilly portfolio; CVS additional positive announcement June 5 (Zepbound/Foundayo); Q1 revenue +56% YoY; 60.1% GLP-1 market share.

Adding to a winner — LLY +5.99% from original entry at time of scale-up decision. Scale from 7sh (7.97% weight) to 10sh (~11.4% weight) on fundamental confirmation, not chasing.
- **Stop (3 new shares):** 10% trailing stop placed (order id: 25989fb5-eedd-47f1-bde5-569c16f4e102) — HWM $1,140.82, initial stop $1,026.74, GTC exp 2026-09-03
- **Verified:** 10 shares confirmed in positions (avg entry $1,093.534, market value ~$11,395) ✓; trailing stop 25989fb5 confirmed active (status: new) ✓; original 7-share stop d4147484 (HWM $1,155.74, stop $1,040.17 — auto-ratcheted today to new portfolio HWM) also confirmed ✓

### Guardrail checks at execution
- Cash after fill: $64,047.09 (64.2%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- LLY 10sh × ~$1,140 = ~$11,400 = 11.4% of equity ✓ (≤20% cap)

### Position review (EOD June 4)
- **LLY** ($1,123.39, **+4.70% from entry $1,072.944**, **+4.14% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST performer today. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 Bridge July 1 catalyst continuing to drive price. Closed $25.71 below HWM $1,149.10 — no ratchet. Stop $1,034.19 ($89.20 above current, 7.9% buffer). Scale-up primary candidate at June 5 pre-market.
- **META** ($623.74, **+0.50% from entry $620.637**, **+0.12% today**) ✓ — Gave back afternoon gains. HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ($45.59 buffer). AI ad thesis intact. Dividend June 25.
- **MSFT** ($427.60, **+1.25% from entry $422.31**, **+0.06% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($7.91 buffer, 1.9%).
- **NVDA** ($219.26, **+1.37% from entry $216.302**, **+2.10% today**) ✓ — Recovered from pre-market weakness, closed solidly above entry. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($10.21 buffer, 4.7% — improved vs midday 4.1%). Thesis intact.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)

- META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META closed below HWM)
- LLY (d4147484): HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ✓ — unchanged (LLY closed $25.71 below HWM)
- NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged (NVDA closed $13.02 below HWM)
- MSFT (a55a3db6): HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ✓ — unchanged (MSFT closed $38.72 below HWM)

### Performance (EOD June 4)
- **Equity:** $99,820.82
- **Today P/L:** −$948.88 (−0.94%) — AVGO gap-down vs prior mark (~−$1,413) partially offset by remaining-position gains (+$464.17: LLY +$312.27, NVDA +$135.30, META +$11.40, MSFT +$5.20)
- **SPY close June 4:** $757.55 (+0.36% today from $754.80 June 3 close). Bull lagged SPY by −1.30% today.
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.18% ($100K → $99,820.82) vs SPY +2.45% ($739.44 → $757.55) = **−2.63% gap** (widened from −2.26% at midday as SPY climbed in the afternoon)

### Notes
- Today was entirely driven by the AVGO gap-down. AVGO's trailing stop filled at $408.61 at open (vs June 3 mark ~$485), creating a ~$1,413 unrealized-to-realized loss vs the prior close. The remaining 4 positions showed net gains (+$464), primarily led by LLY (+4.14%).
- LLY continues to be the portfolio's standout. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 coverage agreement and the July 1 Bridge program are driving sustained institutional interest. At $1,123.39, LLY is $25.71 below its all-time portfolio HWM of $1,149.10. A breakout above that level would ratchet the trailing stop higher. Scale-up of +3 shares (~10.5% portfolio weight) remains the top candidate for June 5.
- NVDA recovered well, closing at $219.26 (+2.10% today) vs the alarming pre-market level of $212.53. The AVGO sympathy selling dissipated entirely. Stop buffer improved to 4.7% ($10.21). Ex-div credit $7.50 should appear in account.
- META and MSFT essentially flat days — consistent with the broader AI sector digesting AVGO results.
- **Key event tomorrow:** May Nonfarm Payrolls (June 5, 8:30 AM ET). Strong payrolls = potential yield spike = caution on high-multiple AI names. Evaluate before any trades.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used. 2 slots remaining. Plan: evaluate LLY scale-up (+3 shares) and/or V (Visa) at June 5 pre-market, contingent on NFP read and WTI oil remaining below $100.

## 2026-06-04 12:34 ET — MIDDAY CHECK (no trades)

### Position review (12:34 ET)
- **LLY** ($1,138.18, **+6.08% from entry $1,072.944**, **+5.51% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST session since entry. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 coverage agreement catalysts continuing to drive price. HWM $1,149.10 (not yet exceeded — $10.92 below HWM), stop $1,034.19 ($103.99 above current, 9.1% buffer). -7% cut threshold $997.84 (very remote). Tighten rule at $1,233.89 — not triggered.
- **META** ($632.255, **+1.87% from entry $620.637**, **+1.49% today**) ✓ — **HWM ratcheted to $642.38** (from $637.66 at open — META hit intraday high $642.38 today). Stop ratcheted to **$578.142** (from $573.894). AI ad thesis validating. -7% cut threshold $577.19. Tighten rule at $713.73 — not triggered.
- **MSFT** ($427.71, **+1.28% from entry $422.31**, **+0.09% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($7.02 buffer, 1.6%). -7% cut threshold $392.75. Tighten rule at $485.66 — not triggered.
- **NVDA** ($217.97, **+0.77% from entry $216.302**, **+1.50% today**) ✓ — **Recovered strongly** from pre-market level ($212.53). Now comfortably above entry. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($8.92 buffer, 4.1%). -7% cut threshold $201.16. Tighten rule at $248.75 — not triggered.

- No position below −7% cut threshold (best: NVDA +0.77%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (best: LLY +6.08%, threshold $1,233.89) ✓
- All 4 trailing stops confirmed active (live Alpaca orders):

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $100,024.52 (up +$250.17 from open $99,774.35)
- **Today's P/L vs yesterday close:** −$745.18 (equity $100,769.70 → $100,024.52) — AVGO gap-down realized loss (~−$1,404 vs prior close) partially offset by intraday gains on remaining positions (+$658.93 combined)
- **SPY (12:34 ET):** $756.31 (+0.50% today from $752.69 open)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull +0.02% ($100K → $100,024.52) vs SPY +2.28% ($739.44 → $756.31) = **−2.26% gap** (slightly worse than market-open gap of −2.03% as SPY rallied intraday)
- **Intraday unrealized gains by position:** LLY +$415.80, NVDA +$96.60, META +$139.13, MSFT +$7.40 = **+$658.93 total**

### Notes
- LLY's strong session (+5.51%) is the standout today. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 bridge program catalyst (effective July 1) continues driving price. LLY at $1,138.18 is within $10.92 of its all-time HWM ($1,149.10) — if it breaches that level, the stop will ratchet above $1,034.19. Watch at close.
- NVDA recovered sharply from pre-market level ($212.53 at 08:07) to $217.97 at midday (+2.6% from pre-market lows). The initial AVGO sympathy selling pressure at open has fully dissipated.
- META ratcheted HWM to $642.38 intraday. Broker auto-protection is working. Stop now tighter at $578.142.
- MSFT essentially flat today — Azure AI thesis unchanged, no newsflow.
- WTI oil check: per pre-market data $95.68; monitoring approach to $100 halt trigger. No new buys today regardless.
- Week of June 1: 1/3 new positions used. Slots 2 and 3 remain for June 5+ evaluation (LLY scale-up +3 shares, and/or V/new name).

## 2026-06-04 09:35 ET — MARKET OPEN (no trades — AVGO trailing stop executed at open)
- **Action:** None — no new positions. AVGO trailing stop (a8e344f4) executed automatically at open.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 09:35 ET — next close 16:00 ET June 4)
- **Account:** Equity $99,774.35 | Cash $67,471.84 (67.6%) | Long market value $32,302.51

### AVGO — EXIT via trailing stop (confirmed fill)
- **Action:** SELL 20 shares AVGO (trailing stop order a8e344f4, filled at open)
- **Fill:** 20 shares @ $408.61 avg (filled 09:34 ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** Trailing stop (HWM $495.00, stop $445.50) triggered on gap-down after AVGO Q2 FY2026 earnings. Stock opened ~$408-409, well below the $445.50 stop level — gap risk realized. Stop executes at market price when stock opens below the stop level. No manual intervention needed or appropriate.
- **P/L from entry:** 20sh × ($408.61 − $417.366) = **−$175.12 (−2.1%)** from entry. Note: June 3 close was ~$485.25; gap-down loss vs mark = ~−$1,528 unrealized erased overnight.
- **Verified:** AVGO absent from positions ✓. Stop order a8e344f4 shows status "filled" at $408.61 ✓. Cash increased from $59,299.64 → $67,471.84 (+$8,172.20 = 20 × $408.61 proceeds) ✓.

### Remaining 4 positions (09:35 ET)
- **META** ($636.35, **+2.4% from entry $620.637**, **+2.1% today**) ✓ — **NEW HWM $637.66** (ratcheted from $624.81 — META surged at open, triggering broker ratchet). Stop ratcheted to **$573.894** (from $562.329). AI ad thesis validating strongly. Medicare GLP-1 macro environment constructive.
- **LLY** ($1,104.79, **+3.0% from entry $1,072.944**, **+2.1% today**) ✓ — Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis playing out. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($70.60 buffer, 6.4%). Thesis STRONGEST in portfolio.
- **MSFT** ($430.14, **+1.9% from entry $422.31**, **+0.5% today**) ✓ — Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($10.45 buffer, 2.5%).
- **NVDA** ($214.65, **−0.8% from entry $216.302**, **−0.1% today**) ✓ — AVGO sympathy selling did NOT trigger NVDA stop at open. Price $214.65 vs stop $209.052 — buffer $5.60 (2.6%). HWM $232.28. Thesis intact (AI accelerator monopoly). Ex-div credit $7.50 expected today or next business day.

## 2026-06-03 15:53 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` (next close 16:00 ET — running at 15:53 ET June 3)
- **Account:** Equity $100,950.97 | Cash $59,299.66 (58.7%) | Long market value $41,651.31
- **AVGO** ($485.25, +16.27% from entry $417.366, **+0.76% today**) ✓ — Steady ahead of earnings TONIGHT. HWM $495.00, stop $445.50. No new HWM ($485.25 < $495.00 HWM). DO NOT ADD. Scale plan active for June 4 open (see portfolio.md).
- **META** ($622.32, +0.27% from entry $620.637, **+4.13% today**) ✓ — Strong recovery. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329. META came to within $2.49 of its HWM but did not exceed it — no ratchet. Thesis validating. Dividend June 25 ($7.875).
- **LLY** ($1,082.53, +0.89% from entry $1,072.944, **+1.73% today**) ✓ — Solid day. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($48.34 above current). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact.
- **MSFT** ($428.25, +1.41% from entry $422.31, **−2.96% today**) ✓ — Continued Build conference "sell the news" pullback. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($8.56 above current). Thesis intact — Azure AI secular growth story unchanged.
- **NVDA** ($215.665, −0.29% from entry $216.302, **−3.21% today**) ✓ — **EX-DIVIDEND TODAY.** 30sh × USD 0.25 = USD 7.50 credit. Price decline −3.21% is predominantly market-driven AI softness, not the dividend (which is only ~0.11% dilution on price). HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($6.61 above current). Thesis intact.
- **Trailing stops — all 5 confirmed active (verified via Alpaca open orders):**
  - AVGO (a8e344f4): HWM $495.00, stop $445.50 ✓ — unchanged
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ✓ — unchanged
  - MSFT (a55a3db6): HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ✓ — unchanged

  - NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged
  - AMZN (bbcd70fa): CANCELED ✓ (confirmed in orders, position closed at midday)
- **Today P/L:** −$166.60 (−0.16% vs June 2 close $101,117.57). META +4.13% ($370.35) and LLY +1.73% ($128.66) were positives; MSFT −2.96% (−$261.20) and NVDA −3.21% (−$214.65) were drags. AVGO +0.76% (+$73.60) offset partially.
- **SPY close June 3:** $754.80 (−0.61% from June 2 close $759.47). Bull outperformed SPY by **+0.45% today**.
- **Since inception:** Bull +0.95% vs SPY +2.08% = **−1.13%** gap (improved from −1.23% at midday; META recovery closed the gap slightly).
- **Note:** Session characterized by rotation within the portfolio. META had its best single-day since entry (+4.13%), nearly recovering to its all-time high in our book ($624.81). MSFT continues the anticipated "sell the news" pattern from the Build conference — now −7.7% from its Build Day 1 high but still $8.56 above its stop. NVDA ex-dividend day — the $7.50 credit will appear in account. AVGO held steady ahead of tonight's pivotal earnings print. No positions triggered any guardrail today. All stops intact.
- **AVGO earnings TONIGHT (after close):** Scale plan for June 4 open — see portfolio.md. This is the decisive event for the week.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining. AMZN close does NOT consume a slot (exits are not new positions).

## 2026-06-03 12:33 ET — MIDDAY CHECK — SELL AMZN
- **Action:** SELL 30 shares AMZN (market order) — −7% cut rule triggered
- **Fill:** 30 shares @ $249.21 avg (order id: 35f52817-62dc-4c02-a41a-d36048f8b9e9) — filled immediately
- **Why:** AMZN hit $249.23 at 12:33 ET, breaching the −7% cut threshold of $250.29 (entry $269.13 × 0.93). Rule is mechanical: no discretion. The position had drifted lower over 6 consecutive sessions driven by European cloud regulatory headwinds, AWS talent concerns, and heavy capex cycle. While the long-term AWS thesis ($364B backlog, Prime Day June 23–26) remained intact, the thesis was failing to hold price above the protective level. Capital is better protected and redeployed on a fresh entry with better R/R than riding a positional loser below the guardrail.
- **Stop:** Trailing stop (bbcd70fa) CANCELED prior to close — confirmed canceled in orders. No orphaned orders.
- **Loss:** 30sh × ($249.21 − $269.13) = −$597.60 (−7.39%). Proceeds ~$7,476.30 returned to cash.
- **Verified:** AMZN absent from positions re-fetch ✓. AMZN trailing stop (bbcd70fa) confirmed canceled ✓. 5 positions remain.

- **META** ($611.40, −1.49% from entry $620.637, **+2.13% today**) ✓ — Recovering strongly today. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ($48.07 above current). AI ad thesis intact.
- **LLY** ($1,066.10, −0.64% from entry $1,072.94, **−0.01% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($31.91 above current). Thesis intact (Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1).
- **AMZN** ($256.135, −4.84% from entry $269.13, **−0.19% today**) ⚠️ WATCH — Soft again. Cut threshold $250.29 ($5.84 above current). Stop $247.275 ($8.86 above current). **Midday check critical: close AMZN if price < $250.29 per −7% rule.**
- **NVDA** ($219.32, +1.41% from entry $216.302, **−1.56% today**) ✓ — **EX-DIVIDEND TODAY** ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit). Price down intraday partly reflecting ex-div adjustment. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($10.27 above current). Normal. Credit expected today or next business day.
- **Trailing stops — all 6 confirmed active (verified via Alpaca open orders):**

  - NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged
- **Guardrail check:** No position below −7% cut threshold (worst: AMZN −4.84%). AVGO +15% tighten rule: at +14.71% — just below trigger, and WAIVED regardless (earnings tonight). All stops active. Cash 51.3% > 5%. Week: 1/3 positions used. No action warranted.
- **SPY:** $757.72 at 09:37 ET. Since inception: Bull +0.99% vs SPY +2.47% = **−1.48%** gap. (Equity declined ~$127 from yesterday's close of $101,117.57 — broad softness at open, AVGO giving back pre-market gains, MSFT continuing Build Day 2 pullback.)
- **Today's plan:** No trades. Hold all 6 positions. AVGO earnings after close tonight is the week's pivotal event. AMZN midday cut threshold $250.29 remains the active risk management trigger.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining.

## 2026-06-02 15:51 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal
- **Market status:** `is_open: true`, next close 16:00 ET (confirmed via clock)
- **Account:** Equity $101,117.57 | Cash $51,823.36 (51.3%) | Long market value $49,294.21
- **AVGO** ($479.39, +14.86% from entry $417.37, **+4.22% today**) ✓ — Intraday HWM $488.82 (broker ratcheted), stop $439.938. At close AVGO is $0.60 below the +15% tighten rule ($479.98) — tighten rule waived regardless (AVGO earnings TONIGHT June 3 after close). Plan: if AI revenue >$5B + guidance raised → scale to 12–14% at June 4 open. DO NOT ADD before print.
- **MSFT** ($441.63, +4.57% from entry $422.31, **-4.10% today**) ✓ — Severe "sell the news" on Build Day 1 (from $460.52 June 1 close to $441.63). HWM $466.32, stop $419.688. MSFT is $22 above stop — safe. Build Day 2 tomorrow. Thesis (Azure AI +40%, Copilot enterprise moat) intact.
- **META** ($600.37, -3.27% from entry $620.64, **-0.02% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat today. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 unchanged.
- **LLY** ($1,067.99, -0.46% from entry $1,072.94, **-1.31% today**) ✓ — Mild drift. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 unchanged.
- **AMZN** ($257.70, -4.25% from entry $269.13, **-1.36% today**) ⚠️ WATCH — Cut threshold $250.29 ($7.40 above it). Stop $247.275 ($10.43 above current). Fourth consecutive down session. Thesis intact but price action persistently soft. **Tomorrow midday: close if AMZN < $250.29.**
- **NVDA** ($222.14, +2.70% from entry $216.302, **-0.99% today**) ✓ — HWM $232.28, stop $209.052. **Ex-dividend TOMORROW June 3** ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit).
- **Trailing stops — all 6 confirmed active:**
  - AVGO (a8e344f4): HWM $488.82 (ratcheted intraday), stop $439.938 ✓
  - MSFT (a55a3db6): HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ✓ — unchanged

  - NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged
- **Today P/L:** −$266.64 (−0.26%). MSFT −4.10% was primary drag; AVGO +4.22% was primary offset.
- **SPY:** $759.40 (+0.10% today). Bull underperformed SPY by −0.36% today.
- **Since inception:** Bull +1.12% vs SPY +2.70% = **−1.58%** gap (widened from −1.25% at midday; cash drag 51.3% is structural driver).
- **Note:** Today's dominant story was MSFT Build Day 1 "sell the news" — the stock gave back −4.10% as expected, from $460.52 to $441.63. This is the most severe single-day drop for MSFT in our portfolio but was explicitly anticipated in pre-market research ("classic sell the news"). Stop at $419.688 is $22 below current price — well protected. AVGO had a strong session (+4.22%, intraday high $488.82 ratcheting the stop) heading into tonight's earnings. The AVGO print is the week's pivotal event — a strong beat (AI revenue >$5B, guidance raised) unlocks the June 4 scale-up plan. AMZN is the portfolio's concern: four consecutive soft sessions, now −4.25% from entry with only $7.40 of margin above the −7% midday cut rule. NVDA ex-div tomorrow ($7.50 credit). No positions triggered any guardrail today.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining. No trades today.

- **AVGO** ($483.01, +15.73% from entry $417.37) ✓ — **Qualifies for +15% stop tightening rule, but WAIVED.** Earnings TOMORROW June 3 after close; tightening from 10% to 7% (stop ~$454.60) risks being triggered on earnings-night volatility and would undermine the planned post-earnings scale-up. Existing 10% stop (HWM $488.82, stop $439.938) already locks in +5.4% from entry if triggered. HWM unchanged — AVGO intraday at $483 is below $488.82 HWM. DO NOT ADD before earnings.

- **No position below -7% cut threshold. AVGO +15.73% qualifies for stop tightening — discretion exercised to hold 10% stop through earnings tomorrow.**
- **Portfolio:** Equity $101,428.32 (+$44.11 from yesterday close $101,384.21) | Cash $51,823.36 (51.1%)
- **SPY midday:** $759.23. Since inception: Bull +1.43% vs SPY +2.68% = **-1.25%** gap (widened slightly from -1.01% at market open due to cash drag while SPY continues higher).

- **Since inception:** Bull +1.37% vs SPY +2.60% = **−1.23%** gap (widened from −1.07% Friday; cash drag primary driver at 51% cash).
- **Note:** Mixed close session. NVDA led (+5.47% — Computex RTX Spark enthusiasm continued to EOD, new HWM $222.694, stop ratcheted to $200.42). MSFT (+2.34%) and AVGO (+2.53%) both strong ahead of key catalysts (Build conference June 2–3 for MSFT, earnings June 3 for AVGO). META had a rough first day (−4.59% from prior session's $632.51 close; −2.76% from our entry $620.64) — early softness is normal for a new position and the AI advertising thesis remains intact. AMZN soft (−3.22%) and LLY pulled back mildly (−2.03% — possible "buy the rumour, sell the news" on CVS Foundayo launch today). All 6 positions remain well above −7% cut threshold.

AMZN weakest today (−2.88%) but only −2.33% from entry — well above the −7% cut at $250.29. No action warranted. June 3 AVGO earnings remain the key event for the week.

- **Portfolio equity:** $101,109.60 (new equity high) | Cash: $61,132.91 (60.5%)
- **Note:** Strong open driven by MSFT (+2.88% — four consecutive strong sessions; Azure AI thesis intact) and AVGO (+2.64% — ahead of June 3 earnings, analysts bullish). Both trailing stops ratcheted materially: MSFT HWM $429.49→$439.87 (+$10.38), AVGO HWM $435.31→$439.52 (+$4.21). NVDA softest at −1.38% from entry but safely above −7% cut threshold and stop at $196.36. No position approaches any guardrail threshold. Pre-market plan: NO TRADES. COST earnings missed strong-beat criteria (EPS $4.93 vs $5.10 threshold). Final weekly slot (1 of 3) carried to week of June 1. Candidates: META (ad-tech AI flywheel) or LLY scale-up post-AVGO earnings June 3. Do not rush.

AVGO (+1.08%) and AMZN (+0.76%) also solid. NVDA only softly positive (+0.68%) — still the portfolio laggard at −1.04% from entry but well within the −7% threshold. All five unrealized positions net +$737.32. AMZN HWM ratcheted as it closed above prior HWM. No action warranted. Portfolio at new equity high $100,732.77.
