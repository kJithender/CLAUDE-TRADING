### Performance (midday June 22, ~12:31 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,201.16 (vs last_equity $99,039.61 = +$161.55 = **+0.163% intraday**)
- **Unrealized P/L (from entry):** LLY +$152.81 (+1.40%), NVDA −$123.28 (−1.75%), V +$125.73 (+1.77%), VST +$731.20 (+12.28%) = net **+$886.46**
- **Cash:** $67,261.74 (67.80%) | Long market value: $31,935.43
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−0.799%** ($100,000 → $99,201.16) vs SPY **+0.91% est** (SPY $744.42 + $1.76 div / $739.44) = **Bull TRAILS SPY ~1.71pp** (improved from ~2.12pp at market-open)
- **Week of June 22:** 1/3 new positions used (NVDA)

### Notes
- VST is the standout again (+12.28% from entry, +2.04% today). Helix/Cogentrix thesis working. News scan confirms thesis-driven move, not noise. Approaching +15% tighten trigger ($171.13) — close routine should monitor closely and tighten if hit.
- NVDA mild intraday pullback (−1.75% from entry, −0.48% today) — normal volatility in a new starter position. No catalyst-based concern. Stop buffer 8.15% intact.
- LLY and V both healthy — Medicare Bridge July 1 catalyst in 9 days requires explicit hold/trim/exit decision at pre-market June 30.
- No urgency to act. Risk is well-managed. No new positions (midday is risk management only per playbook).

| FOMC gate | LIFTED at 2 PM ET today — hawkish dot plot now active constraint | — | ⚠️ 10yr > 4.75% → halt buys |

### Market context (June 17, 2026)
Fed held rates (3.50–3.75%) but issued a hawkish dot plot: 9 of 18 FOMC members project a rate hike by year-end — the first Fed meeting under new Chair Kevin Warsh. Bond yields surged on the surprise hawkish signal. Tech bellwethers (MSFT, META, GOOGL, AMZN) led broad losses. SPY fell −1.44% ($751.01 → $740.23). Bull's 75% cash cushion provided strong relative protection — portfolio fell only −0.17% today. The hawkish dot plot is a direct threat to high-multiple tech names and to the rate-sensitive components of Bull's watchlist; 10yr yield level vs the 4.75% trigger is the critical variable for pre-market Thursday.

### Performance (EOD June 17)
- **Equity:** $99,037.62 (vs last_equity $99,202.67 = −$165.05 today = **−0.166%**)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY −$103.70 (−0.924%), V −$53.35 (−0.728%), VST −$8.00 (−0.126%) = net **−$165.05** ✓
- **Unrealized P/L (from entry):** LLY +$185.96 (+1.70%), V +$156.75 (+2.20%), VST +$384.00 (+6.45%) = net **+$726.71**
- **Cash:** $74,304.63 (75.02%) | Long market value: $24,732.99
- **SPY today (June 17 close):** $740.23 (vs $751.01 June 16 close = **−1.435% today**)
- **Bull today vs SPY today:** −0.166% vs −1.435% = **+1.269pp outperformance today** ✓ (75% cash was the shield)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−0.963%** ($100,000 → $99,037.62) vs SPY **+0.107%** ($740.23) = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~1.07pp**
- Gap improvement: −2.35pp (EOD Jun 16) → **−1.07pp (EOD Jun 17)** — dramatic narrowing as SPY's FOMC-driven −1.44% selloff compressed the benchmark while Bull's high-cash posture held.

### Race scoreboard (EOD June 17)
- Bull: **−0.963%** (since May 21, USD 100K start)
- AGGRO: **~−5.0% est** (since June 4; midday June 17 −4.27%; MSFT had only 2.29pp buffer from −12% forced cut at midday — hawkish FOMC afternoon selloff likely crystallized losses)
- SPY vs Bull inception: **+0.107%** (since May 21, $739.44 anchor)
- Bull leads AGGRO by ~4pp (est.). Bull nearly at par with SPY.

### Notes
- Clean EOD. No exits, no cuts, no stop breaches. VST exceptional: hit a new position HWM of $162.44 during a broad FOMC-driven selloff — the nuclear/Helix thesis is proving structurally non-correlated to rate-hike fears. LLY and V both mild decliners (−0.92%, −0.73%) reflecting sector-level rate sensitivity, not thesis-specific negative catalysts.
- The 75% cash posture delivered its clearest demonstration yet: Bull −0.17% vs SPY −1.44% = +1.27pp relative outperformance on a hawkish Fed day. The since-inception gap narrowed from −2.35pp to −1.07pp in a single session. This is precisely the scenario where the high-cash build-phase strategy proves its value.
- **FOMC gate LIFTED** but hawkish surprise changes the deployment calculus. Pre-market Thursday MUST: (1) confirm 10yr Treasury yield level vs 4.75% trigger before placing any orders; (2) if 10yr is above 4.75%, halt all new buys for the week; (3) if 10yr is below 4.75%, NVDA remains priority candidate if basing above $205 with ATR ≤3%.
- **SPY ex-dividend June 18 (TOMORROW):** $1.76/sh. After tomorrow, SPY total-return anchor adjusts to $741.20. Pre-market June 18 must update the benchmark anchor — the reported gap will narrow by ~0.238pp once the dividend is credited.
- No new lessons to add (no losses, no new errors today).

### Notes
- Clean market-open. FOMC gate correctly holds — no trades today. Plan was correctly empty.
- **V ⬆️ ratchet notable:** V auto-ratcheted HWM $333.08→$336.07, stop $299.772→$302.463 since yesterday EOD. V has traded above $333.08 today, reaching at least $336.07. Best stop buffer reading for V since entry.
- FOMC announcement today at 2 PM ET — close routine will assess outcome and set the Thursday deployment plan.
- Post-FOMC priority (close routine): (1) NVDA 33sh if above $205 with normalizing ATR; (2) LRCX if ATR finally ≤3%; (3) PWR after TD Cowen conference dust settles.

### Market context (June 16, 2026)
FOMC Day 1 started; markets little changed as investors awaited Wednesday's rate decision. SpaceX surged 20% on an AI deal announcement (second consecutive day of strong SPCX performance). Housing starts fell 15.4% unexpectedly in May — weakest reading since May 2020 — a sign of rate-sensitive real economy softening that ironically supports eventual Fed easing. SPY ended −0.50% ($754.75 → $751.01). Bull's portfolio outperformed: V +2.71% (financials pricing in rate-hold) and VST +3.66% (continued Helix momentum) offset LLY −0.63% (FOMC-day healthcare rotation). Context supportive for all three theses through FOMC announcement Wednesday.

### Performance (EOD June 16)
- **Equity:** $99,209.83 (vs last_equity $98,862.97 = +$346.86 today = **+0.351%**)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY −$71.33 (−0.632%), V +$193.38 (+2.714%), VST +$224.80 (+3.661%) = net **+$346.85** ✓
- **Unrealized P/L:** LLY +$286.835 (+2.62%), V +$198.88 (+2.79%), VST +$413.20 (+6.94%) = net **+$898.915**
- **Cash:** $74,304.63 (74.90%) | Long market value: $24,905.20
- **SPY today (June 16 close):** $751.01 (vs $754.75 June 15 close = **−0.495% today**)
- **Bull today vs SPY today:** +0.351% vs −0.495% = **+0.846pp outperformance today** ✓
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−0.790%** ($100,000 → $99,209.83) vs SPY **+1.564%** ($751.01) = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~2.35pp**
- Gap improvement: −3.07pp (EOD Jun 15) → −2.54pp (midday Jun 16) → **−2.35pp (EOD Jun 16)** — best gap since June 12 EOD
- Note: After June 18 SPY ex-div, SPY total-return anchor adjusts by +0.238pp (→ $741.20), which will narrow the reported gap further.

### Race scoreboard (EOD June 16)
- Bull: **−0.790%** (since May 21, USD 100K start)
- AGGRO: **~−3.94% est** (midday $96,060.12 vs $100K inception June 4; FOMC-day tech softness — MSFT −8.0%, AVGO −6.85% from entries)
- SPY vs Bull inception: **+1.564%** (since May 21, $739.44 anchor)
- Bull leads AGGRO by ~3.15pp (est.).

### Notes
- Clean EOD. All 3 positions held, all theses intact, stop audit 4/4 perfect. Both V and VST made outstanding moves today (+2.71%, +3.66%), with trailing stop HWMs ratcheting to new peaks on both — compounding downside protection. V at $332.61 (+2.79% from entry) confirms financials thesis playing out. VST at $159.14 (+6.94% from entry, third consecutive strong day) continues to validate the Helix/nuclear thesis.
- Today's outperformance (+0.846pp vs SPY) on a down-SPY day is encouraging — the portfolio's sector mix (healthcare, financials, energy/nuclear) is providing genuine non-correlation to AI-tech sell pressure during FOMC caution.
- FOMC gate: No new positions before Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET. After FOMC announcement, deploy slots in order: (1) LRCX if ATR ≤3%; (2) NVDA if basing above $205; (3) PWR (Quanta).
- SPY ex-dividend June 18 ($1.76/sh): after tomorrow close, update SPY total-return anchor to $741.20.

### Market context (June 15, 2026)
US-Iran interim deal to reopen the Strait of Hormuz drove S&P 500 +1.7% (Nasdaq +2.8%, Dow +1.1%). WTI oil fell 5% to ~$80/bbl on easing geopolitical risk. SpaceX (SPCX) +5% on Day 2 of trading. Energy sector tumbled broadly, but VST outperformed +4.61% — nuclear 24/7 reliability thesis proving non-correlated to oil. Iran deal is net constructive for VST (oil decline reduces alternatives competition narrative but nuclear baseload advantage intact). Supports Bull's current position theses (LLY, V, VST all non-correlated to oil price).

### Performance (EOD June 15)
- **Equity:** $98,897.57 (vs last_equity $98,648.01 = +$249.56 today = **+0.253%**)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY −$62.40 (−0.55%), V +$39.38 (+0.55%), VST +$272.80 (+4.61%) = net **+$249.78** (≈ matches Alpaca ✓)
- **Unrealized P/L:** LLY +$332.26 (+3.04%), V +$13.42 (+0.19%), VST +$241.20 (+4.05%) = net **+$586.88**
- **Cash:** $74,304.63 (75.1%) | Long market value: $24,592.94
- **SPY today (June 15 close):** $754.04 (vs $741.02 June 12 close = +1.757% today)
- **Bull today vs SPY today:** +0.25% vs +1.76% = −1.51pp today (75% cash drag — expected; all gains concentrated in VST +4.61%)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−1.10%** ($100,000 → $98,897.57) vs SPY **+1.97%** ($754.04) = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~3.07pp**
- Note: Gap widened from −1.52pp (EOD Jun 12) to −3.07pp today as SPY rallied +1.76% intraday on Iran deal. 75% cash limits capture. Gap expected to narrow as FOMC passes and slots are deployed post-Wednesday.

### Race scoreboard (EOD June 15)
- Bull: **−1.10%** (since May 21, USD 100K start)
- AGGRO: **~−3.0% est** (midday June 15 equity ~$97,008 vs $100K inception June 4; last known EOD June 12: −5.95%)
- SPY vs Bull inception: **+1.97%** (since May 21, $739.44 anchor)
- Bull leads AGGRO by ~1.9pp (est.). AGGRO recovered strongly today on Iran deal + risk-on tech rally.

### Notes
- Clean EOD. All 3 positions held, all theses intact, stop audit 4/4 perfect. Both V and VST trailing stops ratcheted to new HWMs during session — protection compounding. VST the standout today (+4.61%) defying broader energy sector weakness, confirming the Helix/nuclear story is non-correlated to oil price.
- FOMC gate remains active: no new positions before Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET. After FOMC, deploy slots in order: (1) LRCX if ATR ≤3%; (2) NVDA if basing above $205; (3) PWR (Quanta).
- SPY ex-dividend June 18 ($1.76/sh): after Wednesday, update SPY total-return anchor to $741.20 (= $739.44 + $1.76) for accurate benchmarking.

### Notes
- Clean midday — all three positions well within guardrails.

V also performing (+1.13% intraday) with its stop ratcheting to $326.29 HWM. LLY mild softness today (−0.53%) but +3.06% from entry — broad market rotation, no LLY-specific negative catalyst.
- Since-inception gap widened to ~3.37pp as SPY hit $756.33 mid-session — SPY's +2.28% gain since inception vs. Bull's high-cash posture (75% cash) limits capture. This is expected structural drag during the FOMC gate period. No action warranted.
- FOMC gate: No new positions before Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET. All 3 slots held in reserve.
- Stop audit: perfect 4/4. Both V and VST stops ratcheted to new HWMs today — compounding protection on Bull's two strongest intraday performers.

### Market context (June 12, 2026)
SpaceX (SPCX) debuted today at $135/sh, surged ~19% to ~$161 — largest IPO in history ($1.77T valuation) — capturing significant tech capital and creating sector rotation: S&P 500 +0.34%, Dow +0.40%, Nasdaq 100 −0.5%. Amazon −2.17%, Apple −1.95% (SpaceX liquidity absorption). Iran/US peace deal continues to advance; crude oil −2% to ~$85/bbl — direct VST nuclear thesis tailwind. LLY −1.95% intraday (rotation, not thesis-specific). V +0.99% financials resilient. VST +1.09% on oil decline. Context is neutral-to-supportive for all three theses.

### Quarterly SPY dividend note (June quarter mid-month check)
- **Q2 2026 SPY dividend:** $1.76/share, ex-date June 18, 2026 (6 days), pay date July 31, 2026.
- Cumulative SPY dividends since Bull inception May 21, 2026: **$0.00** (Q1 ex-date March 20 was before inception).
- After June 18: SPY total-return adjustment = +$1.76/$739.44 = **+0.238pp** in SPY's favor.
- Current since-inception comparisons use price-only return. After June 18, add $1.76 to SPY anchor for accurate total-return benchmarking.

### Performance (EOD June 12)
- **Equity:** $98,696.00 (vs last_equity $98,788.43 = −$92.43 today = **−0.093%**)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY −$225.95 (−1.95% intraday), V +$69.52 (+0.99%), VST +$64.00 (+1.09%) = net −$92.43 ✓

### Race scoreboard (EOD June 12)
- Bull: **−1.30%** (since May 21, USD 100K start)
- AGGRO: **~−6.04%** (since Jun 4, midday June 12 estimate; last full EOD −5.84% June 11)
- SPY: **+0.21%** (since May 21, Bull's benchmark anchor)
- Bull leads AGGRO by ~4.74pp.

### Notes
- Clean EOD close. All 3 positions held, all theses intact, all stops active. 75.3% cash drag expected in positive sessions. SpaceX IPO rotation was the dominant market story; no portfolio-specific disruptions. Weekly review at 4:30 PM ET today. Week of June 16: 3 fresh slots (LRCX, NVDA, one new name).

### Notes
- A clean midday — all three positions well within guardrails. V continues to strengthen (+1.71% intraday) with its stop auto-ratcheting to $325.93 HWM, building more downside protection. LLY mild softness today (-1.49%) on broader market but +4.58% from entry with strong stop buffer. VST recovering from last week's near-threshold scare — now at $148.13, well above $138.39 cut threshold. Cash 75.1% providing continued cushion. No action warranted.
- SPY up slightly today (~+0.37% from yesterday close), Bull equity essentially flat (+0.021%) — cash drag expected when market is modestly positive. Since-inception gap remains ~-1.33pp but has stabilized.
- Week of June 16: 3 fresh position slots. LRCX re-evaluation as first priority (ATR must normalize to ≤3%). Also evaluating NVDA (post-Senate hearing), and one new name.

### No-trade explicit confirmation
No new positions today. Plan date confirmed 2026-06-12. Reasons: (1) Plan has trades: []; (2) LRCX ATR ~9.95% disqualifies entry; (3) Friday weekend risk — no new parabolic-ATR position before weekend; (4) Slot 3 week of June 8 intentionally expires unused — 4th consecutive deferral, correct and disciplined. All 3 held positions have intact theses and healthy stop buffers.

### Week of June 8 — CLOSED

- **Slot 2:** V — BOUGHT 22sh @ $323.57 (June 10) ✓

- 3-day avg: **~9.95%** — WAY above 3% threshold; stock extended +19.5% in 6 sessions since June 5
- **DECISION: DEFER to week of June 16. Slot 3 expires unused.**

### Cash-drag note (explicit)
Cash 75.1% > strategy target 25-40%. Slot 3 unused. Explicit reasoning: (1) LRCX ATR ~10% — structurally inadvisable; (2) LRCX extended after +19.5% in 6 sessions — not a clean base; (3) Friday weekend risk — new parabolic-ATR position on Friday unacceptable; (4) Existing 3 positions all have intact/upgraded theses with healthy stop buffers. No urgency. Next week: 3 fresh slots.

### Market context (June 11, 2026)
SPY rallied approximately +1.34% today ($727.87 Jun 10 close → $737.62 est. close at 3:51 PM ET), driven primarily by Iran signaling a nuclear deal is imminent — reducing geopolitical oil-price risk premium. The rebound was broad: AI infra, energy, and healthcare participated. LLY +2.36% and VST +5.12% outperformed; V -0.75% lagged as financials rotated. A hot PPI print was noted but did not derail the rally — Iran deal signal dominated. Today's context supports Bull's current position theses.

### Position review (EOD June 11 — ~3:51 PM ET)

**LLY** ($1,163.2201, **+6.37% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.36% today** vs $1,136.37 lastday) ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL

- Stop buffer: $320.55 − $292.959 = **$27.59 (8.60%)** ✓ Healthy.
- Mild weakness (-0.75%) in an up market reflects risk-on rotation away from financials toward cyclicals/energy. Not thesis-specific. OpenAI partnership thesis intact. Review_by July 28. HOLD.

- -7% cut threshold: $138.39 — VST at $145.63 is **$7.24 above it** ✓ Solid cushion.
- 2-day recovery: $138.54 (Wed, only $0.15 above -7% threshold) → $145.63 today (+5.12%) = +$7.09 in 2 sessions. Iran deal expectations reduce oil price pressure; nuclear relative economics improve. Dividend ex-date June 22 in 11 days (USD 9.16 for 40sh). Thesis INTACT and reinforced. HOLD.

### Performance (EOD June 11)

- **SPY today:** ~$737.62 (vs $727.87 Jun 10 close = +$9.75 = +1.34%) — Iran deal expectations drove broad risk-on
- **Bull today vs SPY today:** +0.519% vs +1.34% = **−0.82% underperformance** (75% cash limits upside capture — expected)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.18%** ($100,000 → $98,825.30) vs SPY **-0.25%** (est. $737.62 / $739.44 anchor) = **Bull trails SPY by ~0.93pp**

### Notes
- LLY hit $1,163.22 (+6.37% from entry), now only $19.51 below the portfolio HWM ($1,182.73). A break above HWM on Friday or next week auto-ratchets both stops — compounding protection. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 in 20 days.
- VST's Wednesday crisis ($138.54 close, $0.15 above -7% threshold) resolved decisively: +4.29% Wed + +5.12% today. Iran deal de-escalation improves nuclear relative economics vs. natural gas. Dividend June 22 (USD 9.16 for 40sh).
- V mild drift (-0.75%) in up market — financials/cyclical rotation day, not thesis-specific. Stop buffer 8.60% comfortable.
- Cash drag cost: +0.52% vs SPY +1.34% = -0.82pp underperformance today. Since-inception gap widened to -0.93pp (from midday +0.70pp lead) as SPY rebounded. Expected behavior; the cash cushion repeatedly protected on Jun 5/9/10 down days.
- Week of June 8 CLOSED: 2/3 slots used (VST Jun 9, V Jun 10). Slot 3 unused — deliberate LRCX ATR disqualification ✓. Next week: 3 fresh slots, LRCX re-evaluation priority.
- Race: Bull -1.18% | AGGRO ~-7.0% (midday est.) | SPY -0.25% — Bull leads AGGRO by ~5.8pp.

### Notes
- VST's primary concern from yesterday ($138.54 close, only $0.15 above the -7% threshold) has resolved. The recovery to $144.49 (+4.29% today) is the best intraday move of the three positions. Pre-market and intraday strength confirms no VST-specific negative catalyst — the Iran/oil macro pressure that drove the June 10 selloff is easing. Stop at $135.27 provides a defined floor. Midday check: PASS ✓
- LLY approaching its all-time portfolio HWM ($1,182.73 — only $23.48 away). If LLY breaks through in the afternoon, stops auto-ratchet higher — a positive development. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 in 20 days.
- V at $319.54 (-1.24% from entry) is within normal variance for a 2-day-old position. OpenAI payment integration thesis intact. Stop buffer 8.31% healthy.
- Portfolio is in good shape: 75.3% cash, 3 active positions, all stops active, equity recovering. No action warranted.

### No-trade explicit confirmation
No new positions today. Plan date confirmed 2026-06-11. Reasons: (1) LRCX ATR ~11% disqualifies entry; (2) NVDA Senate Banking hearing 10 AM ET creates mid-session AI semi volatility; (3) May PPI at 8:30 AM (already released — need to monitor 10yr for any spike above 4.75%). Slot 3 week of June 8 intentionally expires unused.

**VST** ($141.40 pre-mkt per positions API, **-4.98% from entry $148.81**, **+2.06% today** vs $138.54 June 10 close) ⬆️ RECOVERING
- Official June 10 close was $138.51 — only $0.12 above the -7% cut threshold $138.39 (more critical than the $138.91 I noted at 15:52 ET Wednesday).
- Pre-market recovery to $141.40 provides $3.01 (2.18%) cushion above threshold. Much improved.
- Stop buffer: $141.40 − $135.270 = **$6.13 (4.33%)** ✓
- No VST-specific negative news. Broad market rebound (+0.78% futures) driving recovery. Dividend ex-date June 22 intact. Thesis unchanged.
- **Decision: HOLD. Stop at $135.27 is the defined floor. Midday check required: if VST < $138.39 at 12:30 PM, close per -7% rule.**

### Macro context (pre-market June 11)
- S&P 500 futures: +0.78% — rebounding from Wednesday's -1.67% SPY decline (actual close $724.73)
- May PPI due 8:30 AM ET — potential rate shock if hot (watch: 10yr crossing 4.75%)
- NVDA Senate Banking hearing at 10 AM ET — Huang declined to testify; non-NVDA witnesses only; AI semi sector sentiment uncertain during session
- Iran/US conflict ongoing; WTI ~$88 (<$100 ✓)

### Thesis contract review
- LLY: invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.46) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by July 1. $1,135.50 >> stop. **INTACT. HOLD.**
- V: invalidation = trailing stop fires ($292.96) or regulatory mandate. review_by July 28. $323.75 >> stop. **INTACT. HOLD.**

### New position decision — Slot 3 (week of June 8)

**LRCX: DEFER — ATR disqualifies entry this week.**
- Next earnings: August 5, 2026 ✓
- Q3 2026 results: +24% revenue YoY, EPS +40% YoY, UBS PT $375 — strong fundamentals
- **ATR check:** June 9 range 13.13%, June 10 range 8.91% — 2-day average ~11% >> 3% threshold
- Even halved position: at 11% ATR, a 10% trailing stop provides ~1 average day of cushion. Unacceptable risk profile.
- NVDA hearing during market session creates additional AI semi uncertainty
- **Decision: DEFER to next week. Slot 3 expires unused — deliberate cash decision, not passive default.**

### Cash-drag note (explicit)
Cash 75.5% > strategy target 25-40%. Slot 3 unused. Explicit reasoning: LRCX ATR ~11% disqualifies entry under volatility rule; NVDA hearing outcome unknown until 10 AM; May PPI unknown until 8:30 AM; VST pre-market recovery needs confirmation through the session. NEXT WEEK: LRCX re-evaluation as first priority if ATR normalizes and AI semi sentiment clears.

### Performance (pre-market June 11)
- **Equity:** $98,438.13 (vs last_equity $98,315.05 — +$123.08 overnight = +0.13%)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.69%** ($98,315.05 at June 10 close) vs SPY **-1.99%** ($724.73 at June 10 close) = **Bull LEADS SPY by +0.30%** — first time definitively ahead since inception

- **Account:** Equity $98,374.22 | Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value $24,069.57

### Market context (June 10, 2026)
S&P 500 fell ~1% today (SPY -0.71% to $727.87). Three drivers: (1) May CPI 4.2% YoY — 3-year high but matched expectations; core CPI 2.9% / 0.2% MoM benign; (2) US-Iran military strikes escalating with near-closure of Strait of Hormuz driving oil higher; (3) AI sector extended selloff (NVDA, Micron). VIX +12%. 10yr yield held ~4.54%, below 4.75% trigger. Bull's 75.5% cash posture provided strong protection: Bull -0.45% vs SPY -0.71% = **+0.26% outperformance today**.

### Position review (EOD June 10)

- No specific VST catalyst — Iran/oil macro pressure + broad market selloff. Nuclear PPAs with Meta + AWS intact. Dividend ex-date June 22 in 12 days (USD 9.16 credit for 40sh).
- **Close routine does NOT cut. -7% rule applies at Thursday midday. Stop at $135.27 is the defined exit floor. Pre-market Thursday: HIGHEST PRIORITY CHECK.**

### Exit reconciliation
- **META** exited today via trailing stop at $578.00 (11:06 AM ET). Post-mortem in closed-trades.md ✓; lesson in lessons.md ✓ (recorded at midday). Ledger current.

### Performance (EOD June 10)
- **Equity:** $98,374.22 (vs last_equity $98,817.64 = -$443.42 today = -0.45%)
- **Today P/L breakdown:** LLY -$41.90, V -$10.78, VST -$292.40, META realized vs prior mark ~-$98 = net ~-$443 ✓
- **Cash:** $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value: $24,069.57
- **SPY today:** $727.87 (vs $733.06 Jun 9 close = -0.71%) — **Bull outperformed SPY by +0.26%**
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **-1.63%** ($100,000 → $98,374.22) vs SPY **-1.57%** ($739.44 → $727.87) = **-0.07% gap** — NEAR PAR, best result since inception

### Notes
- Today was another broad-market down day. Bull's 75.5% cash posture provided real protection: outperforming SPY by +0.26% and narrowing the since-inception gap to just -0.07%. Third consecutive demonstration of the cash cushion (Jun 5, Jun 9, Jun 10).
- **The since-inception gap is now essentially at par (-0.07%).** Despite 5 realized losses totaling ~-$1,689, LLY's +4.29% unrealized gain and cash cushion have held near-parity with SPY.
- **VST is the immediate risk Thursday.** At $138.91 with -7% threshold $138.39, only $0.52 of cushion remains. Iran/oil escalation is the culprit, not a VST-specific catalyst. Stop at $135.27 is the defined exit floor. Do NOT pre-empt unless -7% rule is breached at Thursday midday.
- NVDA Senate Banking hearing June 11 (tomorrow) — watching for AI semi sentiment; affects LRCX slot 3 decision.
- Race: Bull -1.63% | AGGRO ~-6.16% (midday est.) | SPY -1.57% — Bull leads AGGRO by ~4.5pp.

- −7% cut threshold: $1,016.99 — CLEAR. Tighten (+15%) threshold: $1,257.56 — NOT triggered.
- No action.

**V** ($321.085, **−0.77% from entry $323.57**, **−1.22% today** vs $325.05 lastday) ✓ WITHIN RANGE
- Trailing stop 66033918: HWM $325.51, stop **$292.959** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $321.085 − $292.959 = **$28.13 (8.75%)** ✓ Adequate.

**VST** ($139.56, **−6.22% from entry $148.81**, **−4.56% today** vs $146.22 lastday) ⚠️ HIGH WATCH
- Trailing stop c4c200a5: HWM **$150.30**, stop **$135.270** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $139.56 − $135.270 = **$4.29 (3.08%)** ⚠️ Thin.
- −7% cut threshold: **$138.39** — VST is only **$1.17 above it**.
- Live news scan: No VST-specific negative catalyst found. Decline appears broad-market correlated. Nuclear PPA thesis with Meta + AWS unchanged. Q1 adj EBITDA +20% YoY confirmed. Dividend ex-date June 22 intact.
- **Decision: HOLD. Thesis intact. Stop active. −7% rule has NOT been breached ($139.56 > $138.39). Do NOT cut manually — let stop manage exit if deterioration continues. If VST closes below $138.39 or touches $135.27 stop, exit will be automatic.**
- Tighten (+15%) threshold: $171.13 — NOT triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:34 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold: LLY +4.96%, V −0.77%, VST −6.22% ($1.17 above threshold) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold ✓
- Drawdown circuit breaker: Equity $98,429 vs HWM $101,384 = **−2.53%** — well within −10% limit ✓
- Active trailing stops (all 3 confirmed via live Alpaca orders):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓

- Cash $74,304.65 (75.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $98,428.62 (vs last_equity $98,817.64 = −$389.02 today = −0.39%)
- **Today P/L:** META stop fill impact (realized −$639.56 vs yesterday mark); LLY +$30.90 intraday, V −$54.67 intraday, VST −$266.40 intraday
- **Cash:** $74,304.65 (75.5%) | Long market value: $24,123.97
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull **−1.57%** ($100K → $98,428.62)
- **Week of June 8:** 2/3 positions used (VST June 9, V June 10). 1 slot remaining (LRCX deferred — NVDA hearing today June 11 pending).

### Notes
- META trailing stop filled cleanly at $578 this morning. Thesis was intact (AI ad moat, enterprise agents) but the price never recovered to HWM after the June 5 NFP shock. The stop did its job — no manual intervention was appropriate at any point. Post-mortem logged in closed-trades.md; lesson logged in lessons.md.
- VST is the immediate risk. At $139.56 with the −7% threshold at $138.39, only $1.17 of cushion remains. No specific catalyst found — broad market weakness is the culprit. The thesis (nuclear PPAs with Meta + AWS, AI power demand secular tailwind) is unchanged. The stop at $135.27 provides a defined exit floor. DO NOT pre-empt the stop unless the −7% rule is breached at midday. If VST holds $138.39 through close, no action. If it breaches $138.39 before close: close immediately.
- Portfolio now has 3 positions (LLY, V, VST) with 75.5% cash. LLY remains the standout (+4.96%). The high-cash posture is again providing relative protection on a down market day.

- Stop buffer: $587.045 − $578.142 = **$8.90 (1.52%)** ⚠️ VERY THIN — persistent concern.
- −7% cut threshold: $577.19 — META is $9.86 above it. NOT triggered.
- Recovering slightly today (+0.28%) from June 8 close $585.39. AI ad thesis intact.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered.

- +15% tighten threshold: $171.13 — not triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:34 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +4.62%, META −5.41%, VST −3.66%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold ✓

- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $98,734.63 (vs last_equity $98,977.95 = −$243.32 today)
- **Today P/L:** LLY −$50.70, META +$24.83, VST −$217.60 = net −$243.47 (−0.25%)
- **Cash:** $72,753.20 (73.7%) | Long market value: $25,981.43
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −1.27% ($100K → $98,734.63). SPY: est ~$747 area. Gap ~−2.03% est (SPY rebounding strongly, Bull with 73% cash has less exposure to the recovery).

### Notes
- Market quiet at midday — no guardrail triggers. All three positions within acceptable ranges.
- META remains the primary risk. At $587.045 with stop $578.142, the buffer is only 1.52% ($8.90). This has been a persistent concern since June 5. The trailing stop is doing its job — it will fire automatically if breached. Do NOT intervene manually. The AI ad thesis remains intact (enterprise AI agent launch, BofA Buy, $856 target). The price weakness is a macro hangover from June 5 NFP shock, not a thesis break.
- VST's HWM ratcheted to $150.30 (stock cleared $150 post-open before pulling back). Stop now at $135.27 (10% below $150.30). Today's −2.40% move is market-related; nuclear PPAs with Meta/AWS are unchanged. Buffer 5.65% remains adequate.
- LLY pulled back modestly (−0.44%) from yesterday's close ($1,149.15 → $1,144.08). Still well above entry (+4.62%). Stop buffer 6.96%. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 catalyst still 22 days away. No action.
- No new positions at midday per playbook.

- **Why (Slot 1 of 3, week of June 8):** Nuclear power operator with locked 20-year PPAs with Meta + Amazon for AI data-center baseload electricity. Secular AI power demand story — VST owns contracted nuclear capacity to reliably power hyperscaler data centers. Q1 adj EBITDA +20% YoY. $220+ analyst consensus target (49%+ upside at $148.81). Non-correlated to AI semi volatility — portfolio diversification benefit. VST opened $148.73 (≥$145 condition met). 4 of 5 entry signals met (technical below 50-day SMA is the miss; noted caution).
- **Stop (40 shares):** 10% trailing stop placed (order id: c4c200a5-b5fb-454d-bd7e-77ece5909810) — HWM $148.40 (ratcheted from initial $148.01), stop $133.56, GTC exp 2026-09-04

- **Week of June 8:** 1/3 positions used (VST June 9). 2 slots remaining.

### Notes
- VST buy executed cleanly. Opened $148.73, filled at $148.81 avg (reasonable $0.08 slippage). Trailing stop at $133.56 (10% below HWM $148.40) provides defined exit risk.
- LLY approaching its all-time portfolio HWM ($1,182.73) — only $17.64 away. If LLY breaks above today, both stops ratchet higher. Retatrutide Phase 3 data from ADA is fresh bullish fuel. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 is 22 days away.
- META recovering (+1.22% today) from the June 5 NFP shock. Stop buffer improved from pre-market $13.88 to $14.40. No action needed.
- No further trades planned today. V and LRCX remain deferred. 2 slots available for Wednesday/Thursday.

- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 15:53 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $99,019.89 | Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) | Long market value $20,314.29

### Position review (EOD June 8)

**LLY** ($1,148.91, **+5.06% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+1.55% today** vs $1,131.42 lastday close) ✓ STRONG
- Pulled back from midday high ($1,158.69) but closed constructively above entry by a solid margin.
- Both trailing stops last broker-updated at 14:06 ET: HWM **$1,182.73** unchanged (LLY did not exceed HWM after midday), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
- Stop buffer: $1,148.91 − $1,064.457 = **$84.45 (7.35%)** ✓ Well protected.
- Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 now 23 days away. Thesis strongest in portfolio.

**META** ($588.445, **−5.19% from entry $620.637**, **−0.77% today** vs $593.00 lastday close) ⚠️ WATCH
- Trailing stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop **$578.142** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $588.445 − $578.142 = **$10.30 (1.75%)** ⚠️ Narrow — unchanged critical concern from morning.
- Cut threshold: $577.19 (−7%) — META $11.26 above it. NOT triggered.
- SPY opened +0.55% ($743.36) and faded to close $739.30; META tracked the fade. No company-specific news.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered. Tuesday open is critical.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.06%, META −5.19%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY +5.06%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via live Alpaca orders:
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓ (broker last updated 14:06 ET)
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73**, stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ Narrow buffer
- Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions today — WTI oil elevated + no clean setups ✓
- Week of June 8: 0/3 new-position slots used ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### SPY performance
- **SPY today (June 8):** Opened $743.36, closed $739.30 — **−0.55% from open**; essentially **+0.005% from Friday close** ($739.265 → $739.30)
- Since inception SPY $739.44 → $739.30 = **−0.02%**

### Performance (EOD June 8)
- **Equity:** $99,019.89 (up from last_equity $98,853.30)
- **Today P/L:** +$166.59 (+0.17%)
  - LLY intraday: +$174.90 (+$17.49/sh × 10sh)
  - META intraday: −$68.33 (−$4.555/sh × 15sh)
  - Net intraday unrealized: +$106.57; remainder from account mark adjustments
- **SPY today:** essentially flat (+0.005% from Friday close); opened strongly +0.55% then faded all session
- **Bull outperformed SPY today by +0.17%** — modest outperformance as SPY intraday faded
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.98% ($100K → $99,019.89) vs SPY −0.02% ($739.44 → $739.30) = **−0.96% gap** (improved from −1.06% at June 5 close; gap narrowed by +0.10%)

### Notes
- SPY had a deceptive session: gapped up to $743.36 (+0.55%) at open, then faded all day to close at $739.30, essentially flat from Friday. The intraday fade reflected continued Iran/Israel geopolitical caution and risk-off pressure persisting from the June 5 NFP shock.
- LLY closed at $1,148.91 (+1.55%). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 imminent (23 days). Both trailing stops healthy at 7.35% buffer. No action needed.
- META is the key risk overnight. Stop at $578.142 is only $10.30 (1.75%) away. The position has drifted lower each day since June 5 NFP shock. AI ad thesis intact but price action is not confirming. If broad market continues weak Tuesday, the stop will fire — this is the stop doing its job, do NOT override manually.
- No new positions — correct decision. WTI oil $93.67 at pre-market (Iran/Israel). Week of June 8: 0/3 slots used. Research priority Tuesday/Wednesday: V (Visa CFO selling resolution), VST (Vistra once WTI direction clarifies), LRCX (once basing action confirms).

## 2026-06-08 12:35 ET — MIDDAY CHECK (no trades)
- **Action:** None — all positions within guardrail thresholds. No cuts, no stop tightening.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 12:35 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $99,115.29 | Cash $78,705.60 (79.4%) | Long market value $20,409.69

### Position review (12:35 ET)

**LLY** ($1,158.69, **+5.96% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.41% today** vs $1,131.42 lastday) ✓ STRONG
- Both trailing stops auto-ratcheted since market-open: HWM now **$1,182.73** (up from $1,173.23 at open), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
- LLY must have hit $1,182.73+ intraday today, setting a new all-time portfolio HWM. Excellent.
- Cut threshold: $1,016.99 (−7%) — remote. No action.
- Tighten threshold: $1,257.56 (+15%) — not yet reached (+5.96%). No action.
- Stop buffer: $1,158.69 − $1,064.457 = **$94.23 (8.13%)** ✓ Well protected.

**META** ($588.10, **−5.24% from entry $620.637**, **−0.83% today** vs $593.00 lastday) ⚠️ WATCH
- Trailing stop 4ea07e91: HWM $642.38, stop **$578.142** — status "new" ✓
- Stop buffer: $588.10 − $578.142 = **$9.96 (1.69%)** ⚠️ Narrow — same concern as market-open.
- Cut threshold: $577.19 (−7%) — META $10.91 above it. NOT triggered.
- META drifted down −0.83% today from $593 close. AI ad thesis intact; no news-driven selloff.
- No manual action. Stop is active and will fire automatically if triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:35 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.96%, META −5.24%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY +5.96%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via live Alpaca orders:
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,182.73** (**RATCHETED further** from $1,173.23), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,182.73** (**RATCHETED**), stop **$1,064.457** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ Narrow buffer
- Cash $78,705.60 (79.4%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders ✓

### Performance (12:35 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,115.29 (vs open $99,057.34 = +$57.95 today)
- **Today P/L:** +$57.95 (+0.06%) — LLY +$272.70 intraday, META −$73.50 intraday = net ~+$199 (Alpaca unrealized intraday); balance likely account-mark timing
- **Cash:** $78,705.60 (79.4%) | Long market value: $20,409.69
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.89% ($100K → $99,115.29). SPY: estimated ~$742 area. Gap ~−1.35% (estimate).

### Notes
- LLY continues to strengthen. The automatic stop ratchet to HWM $1,182.73 (from $1,173.23 at open) means LLY set a new all-time portfolio high intraday. The floor is now $1,064.457 — a 10% cushion below the HWM, and still well above avg entry $1,093.534. LLY at $1,158.69 is 8.13% above its stop. Thesis triple-confirmed: Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 imminent.
- META remains the concern. At $588.10 with stop $578.142, the buffer is only 1.69% ($9.96). The −7% cut threshold $577.19 is essentially co-located with the stop. Any continuation downward will trigger the stop automatically. AI ad thesis is still intact but price action is not confirming it. Geopolitical risk (Iran/Israel, WTI elevated) continues to weigh on the broad market.
- WTI oil: still monitoring — no new position data available at midday but pre-market was $93.67. No new positions today regardless.
- No action taken. System is managing risk correctly via trailing stops.

## 2026-06-08 09:37 ET — MARKET OPEN (no trades)
- **Action:** None — no new positions. Pre-market plan: no trades due to WTI at $93.67 (approaching $100 halt trigger). Plan is CURRENT (dated today June 8, 2026).
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 09:36 ET — next close 16:00 ET)
- **Account:** Equity $99,057.34 | Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) | Long market value $20,351.74

### Position review (09:37 ET)

**LLY** ($1,161.52, **+6.22% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.54% today** vs June 5 close $1,132.80) ⭐ EXCELLENT
- LLY hit intraday high **$1,171.865** today — **CLEARED the prior HWM of $1,166.29**.
- Both trailing stops (d4147484 and 25989fb5) **auto-ratcheted** to new HWM:
  - Old: HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661
  - **New: HWM $1,173.23, stop $1,055.907** (confirmed via live Alpaca orders) ✓
- Thesis triple-confirmed: Eli Lilly hit $1.01T market cap, Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1, all 3 PBMs covering. Strong upward momentum.
- No action — let stops ratchet with price. ✓

**META** ($583.775, **−6.10% from entry $620.637**, **−1.52% today** vs June 5 close $592.85) ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Intraday low: $579.23** — came within **$1.08 of triggering the $578.142 stop**.
- Current buffer from stop: $583.775 − $578.142 = **$5.63 (0.97%)** — EXTREMELY THIN.
- −7% cut threshold: $577.19 (entry $620.637 × 0.93). Not breached — META at $583.775 is $6.56 above it.
- Thesis intact: AI ad moat, Q1 +33% revenue. Selloff appears to be broad-market/geopolitical (Iran/Israel), not META-specific.
- **No manual action.** Stop at $578.142 is active and will fire automatically if hit. This is the stop doing its job. DO NOT intervene before the midday check.
- If META is still in this range at 12:30 PM midday check: close immediately if price < $577.19 per −7% rule.

### Guardrail checks (09:37 ET)
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +6.22%, threshold $1,257.26) ✓
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +6.22%, META −6.10%) ✓ — META close but not triggered
- Active trailing stops (all 3 confirmed via live Alpaca orders):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,173.23** (**RATCHETED** from $1,166.29), stop **$1,055.907** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,173.23** (**RATCHETED** from $1,166.29), stop **$1,055.907** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM) ⚠️ NARROW BUFFER
- Cash $78,705.60 (79.5%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- New positions this week: 0/3 ✓
- WTI oil ~$93.67 — approaching $100 halt trigger → NO NEW POSITIONS ✓

### Performance (09:37 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,057.34 (vs last_equity $98,853.30) — up +$204.04 from Friday EOD
- **Today P/L:** +$204.04 (+0.21%) — LLY +$273.85 intraday, META −$141.75 intraday (per Alpaca unrealized_intraday_pl) = net +$132.10; remainder likely from account mark timing
- **Cash:** $78,705.60 (79.5%) | Long market value: $20,351.74
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.95% ($100K → $99,057.34). SPY: ~$742.81 (pre-mkt was +0.73% from June 5 close $737.45 = ~$742.81 estimated at open). SPY since inception: $739.44 → ~$742.81 = +0.46%. **Gap: −1.41%** (estimate).

### Notes
- Iran/Israel geopolitical escalation is the dominant macro risk today. WTI at $93.67 (+3.46%) was the basis for no new positions, per pre-market plan. No new positions is the correct decision.
- LLY is the portfolio standout. The stop ratchet to HWM $1,173.23 locks in a $1,055.907 floor (−3.60% from avg entry $1,093.534). LLY is now above entry by 6.22% with a floor well above entry — excellent risk management by design.
- META is on high alert. The $1.08 intraday gap between the low ($579.23) and the stop ($578.142) was extremely narrow. The broad-market Iran/geopolitical selloff is what's driving META lower. If today ends without the stop firing, meta will need close monitoring at midday (12:30 PM) and the −7% rule will be the governing threshold.
- Week of June 8: 0/3 new-position slots used. Next new-position consideration deferred to Tuesday/Wednesday pending WTI stabilization.

## 2026-06-05 15:54 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal. Market open confirmed `is_open: true` (closes 16:00 ET).
- **Account:** Equity $98,916.92 | Cash $78,705.62 (79.6%) | Long market value $20,211.30

### Position review (EOD June 5)
- **LLY** ($1,133.88, **+3.69% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+0.77% today** [+$8.61/sh]) — Pulled back from today's intraday HWM $1,166.29 but closed constructively. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact. Stop buffer: $1,133.88 − $1,049.661 = $84.22 (7.43%). Stops unchanged (LLY closed below HWM today — no further ratchet after midday).
- **META** ($591.51, **−4.69% from entry $620.637**, **−5.75% today** [−$36.06/sh]) ⚠️ WATCH — Major selloff today. Broad market risk-off drove META down sharply. Stop $578.142 — only $13.37 buffer (2.26%). −7% cut threshold $577.19 — META is $14.32 above it. AI ad thesis intact; this appears to be macro-driven (SPY −2.41% today), not a META-specific thesis break. If META opens below $582 on Monday, treat as very high alert.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +3.69%, META −4.69%, threshold −7.00%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +3.69%) ✓
- Active trailing stops confirmed via Alpaca orders:

- Week of June 1: 2/3 new-position slots used. Slot 3 (V/Visa) deferred to next week ✓

### SPY performance
- **SPY today (June 5):** Opened $752.31, closed $739.265 — **−2.41%** from June 4 close $757.55.
  (Also opened at gap-down vs prior close: $757.55 → $752.31 gap = −0.69%; then fell further intraday −1.73%)
- Since inception SPY $739.44 → $739.265 = **−0.02%**

### Performance (EOD June 5)
- **Equity:** $98,916.92 (down from last_equity $99,883.06)
- **Today P/L:** −$966.14 (−0.97%) — detailed: LLY +$86.10, META −$540.90, NVDA realized vs June 4 close −$306.54, MSFT realized vs June 4 close −$164.74 = ~−$926 (close to actual −$966 with minor rounding/timing differences)
- **SPY today:** −2.41% ($757.55 → $739.265)
- **Bull outperformed SPY today by +1.44%** — high cash protected against the market selloff
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −1.08% ($100K → $98,916.92) vs SPY −0.02% ($739.44 → $739.265) = **−1.06% gap** (massively improved from −3.08% at midday; SPY's −2.41% selloff closed the gap)

### Notes
- Today was a significant down day for US equities. SPY fell −2.41% — likely driven by the strong NFP print (172K vs 85–125K consensus) pushing rate-cut expectations further out, combined with pre-existing market weakness.
- Bull's 79% cash position provided substantial downside protection. The high-cash posture, which lagged in the bull run from inception through June 3, paid off today.
- NVDA and MSFT trailing stops that triggered at midday protected against further losses: NVDA closed around $209 area (consistent with stop fill), MSFT similarly. Both would have fallen further in the afternoon session given the market selloff.
- META is the key risk going into next week. At $591.51 with a stop at $578.142 (2.26% buffer), any continued market weakness Monday morning could trigger the stop. The −7% cut threshold ($577.19) is essentially co-located with the stop. At pre-market on Monday, close attention required.
- LLY held up better than the market today (+0.77% vs SPY −2.41%). GLP-1 thesis and July 1 catalyst are holding.
- Week of June 1 final tally: 2/3 slots used (META June 1, LLY +3sh June 5). All 4 exits (AMZN −7.39%, AVGO −2.1%, NVDA −3.36%, MSFT −0.70%) were via guardrails — no discretionary selling. Capital preserved correctly.
- **Weekly review runs at 4:30 PM ET today (Friday June 5).**

## 2026-06-05 12:33 ET — MIDDAY CHECK — NVDA and MSFT trailing stops triggered (no manual action)

- **Action:** None — no manual action. Two trailing stops (NVDA, MSFT) executed automatically earlier in the session. Remaining 2 positions (LLY, META) within guardrail thresholds.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 12:33 ET — next close 16:00 ET June 5)
- **Account:** Equity $99,370.92 | Cash $78,705.62 (79.2%) | Long market value $20,665.30

### NVDA — EXIT via trailing stop (auto-executed 11:20 AM ET)
- **Action:** SELL 30 shares NVDA (trailing stop order 8c6b9680, filled 11:20 AM ET)
- **Fill:** 30 shares @ $209.042 avg (filled ~11:20 AM ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** NVDA stop (HWM $232.28, stop $209.052) triggered on intraday decline. At market-open NVDA was at $213.50 with only $4.45 buffer (2.1%) — flagged as ⚠️ watch at the open routine. Senator Warren Senate Banking hearing June 11 regulatory noise continued to weigh. Stop filled near the trigger level ($209.042 vs $209.052 stop — essentially at stop price, no meaningful gap).
- **P/L from entry:** 30sh × ($209.042 − $216.302) = **−$217.80 (−3.36%)** from entry. Thesis was intact but the price never recovered above entry after the AVGO sympathy selling June 4.
- **Verified:** NVDA absent from positions ✓. Stop order 8c6b9680 shows status "filled" at $209.042 ✓. No orphaned orders for NVDA.

### MSFT — EXIT via trailing stop (auto-executed 12:08 PM ET)
- **Action:** SELL 20 shares MSFT (trailing stop order a55a3db6, filled ~12:08 PM ET)
- **Fill:** 20 shares @ $419.363 avg (filled ~12:08 PM ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** MSFT stop (HWM $466.32, stop $419.688) triggered on intraday decline. At market-open MSFT was at $427.67 with only $7.98 buffer (1.9%) — flagged as ⚠️ narrow. The stock had been under pressure since the Build conference "sell the news" pattern and deteriorated further today. Stop filled slightly below the $419.688 trigger level ($419.363 — small gap of $0.325).
- **P/L from entry:** 20sh × ($419.363 − $422.31) = **−$58.94 (−0.70%)** from entry. Azure AI thesis was intact but price action failed to recover from the post-Build pullback.
- **Verified:** MSFT absent from positions ✓. Stop order a55a3db6 shows status "filled" at $419.363 ✓. No orphaned orders for MSFT.

### Remaining position review (12:33 ET)
- **LLY** ($1,153.41, **+5.48% from avg entry $1,093.534**, **+2.50% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST position. LLY set new HWM $1,166.29 today; both stops auto-ratcheted (d4147484 + 25989fb5, each HWM $1,166.29, stop $1,049.661). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact. Tighten threshold at $1,257.56 (+15%) — not triggered. Cut threshold $1,016.99 (−7%) — remote. **No action.**
- **META** ($608.71, **−1.92% from entry $620.637**, **−3.00% today**) ✓ — Weaker today. Stop $578.142 ($30.57 buffer, 4.7% from current price). Cut threshold $577.19 — safely above it. AI ad thesis intact. **No action.**

### Guardrail checks (12:33 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (LLY +5.48%, META −1.92%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (LLY at +5.48%, threshold $1,257.56) ✓
- Active trailing stops (all confirmed):
  - LLY (d4147484): 7sh — HWM **$1,166.29** (auto-ratcheted — new HWM!), stop **$1,049.661** ✓
  - LLY (25989fb5): 3sh — HWM **$1,166.29** (auto-ratcheted), stop **$1,049.661** ✓
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META below HWM today)
  - ~~NVDA (8c6b9680)~~: **FILLED** at $209.042 ✓
  - ~~MSFT (a55a3db6)~~: **FILLED** at $419.363 ✓
- Cash $78,705.62 (79.2%) >> 5% minimum ✓
- No new positions at midday — risk management only ✓
- No orphaned trailing-stop orders for exited positions ✓

### Performance (12:33 ET)
- **Equity:** $99,370.92 (down from $99,883.06 last_equity)
- **Today P/L:** −$512.14 (−0.51%) — NVDA stop exit −$217.80, MSFT stop exit −$58.94, LLY +$281.40 intraday, META −$282.90 intraday = net ~−$278 realized + ~−$1.50 unrealized
- **Cash:** $78,705.62 (79.2%) | Long market value: $20,665.30
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.63% ($100K → $99,370.92) vs SPY ~+2.45% est = **~−3.08% gap** (wider; NVDA and MSFT exits locked in losses)

### Notes
- Both NVDA and MSFT had been flagged with narrow stop buffers at the market-open routine today (NVDA 2.1% buffer, MSFT 1.9% buffer). Both stopped out as the session progressed — this is exactly how the trailing stop protection is meant to work. No manual intervention was appropriate.
- NVDA never recovered above entry ($216.302) after the AVGO sympathy selling on June 4. Senator Warren hearing June 11 added regulatory overhang. With only $4.45 buffer at open, a modest down day was sufficient to trigger.
- MSFT had been under pressure since the Build conference "sell the news" pattern. The stock never returned to its May highs ($466.32 HWM). The narrow $7.98 buffer did not survive today's weakness.
- Portfolio now concentrated in 2 positions (LLY + META) + 79% cash. This is correct — exited positions via guardrails, not thesis breaks. Capital is preserved for future deployment.
- **Week of June 1 new-position count: 2/3 (META June 1 slot 1; LLY scale-up June 5 slot 2). Slot 3 remains.**
- NVDA and MSFT exits do NOT consume weekly new-position slots (exits are not new positions).
- Next consideration: research new candidates for next week (week of June 8). V (Visa) — CFO insider selling concern still unresolved, defer research to next week.

## 2026-06-05 09:38 ET — MARKET OPEN — BUY LLY +3 shares (scale-up, Slot 2)
- **Action:** BUY 3 shares LLY (market order, whole shares for trailing-stop eligibility)

### Position review (EOD June 4)
- **LLY** ($1,123.39, **+4.70% from entry $1,072.944**, **+4.14% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST performer today. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 Bridge July 1 catalyst continuing to drive price. Closed $25.71 below HWM $1,149.10 — no ratchet. Stop $1,034.19 ($89.20 above current, 7.9% buffer). Scale-up primary candidate at June 5 pre-market.
- **META** ($623.74, **+0.50% from entry $620.637**, **+0.12% today**) ✓ — Gave back afternoon gains. HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ($45.59 buffer). AI ad thesis intact. Dividend June 25.
- **MSFT** ($427.60, **+1.25% from entry $422.31**, **+0.06% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($7.91 buffer, 1.9%).
- **NVDA** ($219.26, **+1.37% from entry $216.302**, **+2.10% today**) ✓ — Recovered from pre-market weakness, closed solidly above entry. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($10.21 buffer, 4.7% — improved vs midday 4.1%). Thesis intact.

### Guardrail checks (EOD)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (best: LLY +4.70%) ✓

- Cash $67,471.84 (67.6%) >> 5% minimum ✓

### Trailing stops (EOD — no ratchets today)
- META (4ea07e91): HWM $642.38, stop $578.142 ✓ — unchanged (META closed below HWM)
- LLY (d4147484): HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ✓ — unchanged (LLY closed $25.71 below HWM)
- NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged (NVDA closed $13.02 below HWM)
- MSFT (a55a3db6): HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ✓ — unchanged (MSFT closed $38.72 below HWM)

### Performance (EOD June 4)
- **Equity:** $99,820.82
- **Today P/L:** −$948.88 (−0.94%) — AVGO gap-down vs prior mark (~−$1,413) partially offset by remaining-position gains (+$464.17: LLY +$312.27, NVDA +$135.30, META +$11.40, MSFT +$5.20)
- **SPY close June 4:** $757.55 (+0.36% today from $754.80 June 3 close). Bull lagged SPY by −1.30% today.
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −0.18% ($100K → $99,820.82) vs SPY +2.45% ($739.44 → $757.55) = **−2.63% gap** (widened from −2.26% at midday as SPY climbed in the afternoon)

### Notes
- Today was entirely driven by the AVGO gap-down. AVGO's trailing stop filled at $408.61 at open (vs June 3 mark ~$485), creating a ~$1,413 unrealized-to-realized loss vs the prior close. The remaining 4 positions showed net gains (+$464), primarily led by LLY (+4.14%).
- LLY continues to be the portfolio's standout. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 coverage agreement and the July 1 Bridge program are driving sustained institutional interest. At $1,123.39, LLY is $25.71 below its all-time portfolio HWM of $1,149.10. A breakout above that level would ratchet the trailing stop higher. Scale-up of +3 shares (~10.5% portfolio weight) remains the top candidate for June 5.
- NVDA recovered well, closing at $219.26 (+2.10% today) vs the alarming pre-market level of $212.53. The AVGO sympathy selling dissipated entirely. Stop buffer improved to 4.7% ($10.21). Ex-div credit $7.50 should appear in account.
- META and MSFT essentially flat days — consistent with the broader AI sector digesting AVGO results.
- **Key event tomorrow:** May Nonfarm Payrolls (June 5, 8:30 AM ET). Strong payrolls = potential yield spike = caution on high-multiple AI names. Evaluate before any trades.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used. 2 slots remaining. Plan: evaluate LLY scale-up (+3 shares) and/or V (Visa) at June 5 pre-market, contingent on NFP read and WTI oil remaining below $100.

## 2026-06-04 12:34 ET — MIDDAY CHECK (no trades)

### Position review (12:34 ET)
- **LLY** ($1,138.18, **+6.08% from entry $1,072.944**, **+5.51% today**) ✓ — STRONGEST session since entry. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 coverage agreement catalysts continuing to drive price. HWM $1,149.10 (not yet exceeded — $10.92 below HWM), stop $1,034.19 ($103.99 above current, 9.1% buffer). -7% cut threshold $997.84 (very remote). Tighten rule at $1,233.89 — not triggered.
- **META** ($632.255, **+1.87% from entry $620.637**, **+1.49% today**) ✓ — **HWM ratcheted to $642.38** (from $637.66 at open — META hit intraday high $642.38 today).

- **MSFT** ($427.71, **+1.28% from entry $422.31**, **+0.09% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($7.02 buffer, 1.6%). -7% cut threshold $392.75. Tighten rule at $485.66 — not triggered.
- **NVDA** ($217.97, **+0.77% from entry $216.302**, **+1.50% today**) ✓ — **Recovered strongly** from pre-market level ($212.53). Now comfortably above entry. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($8.92 buffer, 4.1%). -7% cut threshold $201.16. Tighten rule at $248.75 — not triggered.

### Guardrail checks (12:34 ET)
- No position below −7% cut threshold (best: NVDA +0.77%) ✓
- No position above +15% tighten threshold (best: LLY +6.08%, threshold $1,233.89) ✓
- All 4 trailing stops confirmed active (live Alpaca orders):

### Performance (12:34 ET)
- **Equity:** $100,024.52 (up +$250.17 from open $99,774.35)
- **Today's P/L vs yesterday close:** −$745.18 (equity $100,769.70 → $100,024.52) — AVGO gap-down realized loss (~−$1,404 vs prior close) partially offset by intraday gains on remaining positions (+$658.93 combined)
- **SPY (12:34 ET):** $756.31 (+0.50% today from $752.69 open)
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull +0.02% ($100K → $100,024.52) vs SPY +2.28% ($739.44 → $756.31) = **−2.26% gap** (slightly worse than market-open gap of −2.03% as SPY rallied intraday)
- **Intraday unrealized gains by position:** LLY +$415.80, NVDA +$96.60, META +$139.13, MSFT +$7.40 = **+$658.93 total**

### Notes
- LLY's strong session (+5.51%) is the standout today. Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 bridge program catalyst (effective July 1) continues driving price. LLY at $1,138.18 is within $10.92 of its all-time HWM ($1,149.10) — if it breaches that level, the stop will ratchet above $1,034.19. Watch at close.
- NVDA recovered sharply from pre-market level ($212.53 at 08:07) to $217.97 at midday (+2.6% from pre-market lows). The initial AVGO sympathy selling pressure at open has fully dissipated.
- META ratcheted HWM to $642.38 intraday. Broker auto-protection is working. Stop now tighter at $578.142.
- MSFT essentially flat today — Azure AI thesis unchanged, no newsflow.
- WTI oil check: per pre-market data $95.68; monitoring approach to $100 halt trigger. No new buys today regardless.
- Week of June 1: 1/3 new positions used. Slots 2 and 3 remain for June 5+ evaluation (LLY scale-up +3 shares, and/or V/new name).

## 2026-06-04 09:35 ET — MARKET OPEN (no trades — AVGO trailing stop executed at open)
- **Action:** None — no new positions. AVGO trailing stop (a8e344f4) executed automatically at open.
- **Market status:** `is_open: true` ✓ (confirmed via clock at 09:35 ET — next close 16:00 ET June 4)
- **Account:** Equity $99,774.35 | Cash $67,471.84 (67.6%) | Long market value $32,302.51

### AVGO — EXIT via trailing stop (confirmed fill)
- **Action:** SELL 20 shares AVGO (trailing stop order a8e344f4, filled at open)
- **Fill:** 20 shares @ $408.61 avg (filled 09:34 ET — confirmed in orders)
- **Why:** Trailing stop (HWM $495.00, stop $445.50) triggered on gap-down after AVGO Q2 FY2026 earnings. Stock opened ~$408-409, well below the $445.50 stop level — gap risk realized. Stop executes at market price when stock opens below the stop level. No manual intervention needed or appropriate.
- **P/L from entry:** 20sh × ($408.61 − $417.366) = **−$175.12 (−2.1%)** from entry. Note: June 3 close was ~$485.25; gap-down loss vs mark = ~−$1,528 unrealized erased overnight.
- **Verified:** AVGO absent from positions ✓. Stop order a8e344f4 shows status "filled" at $408.61 ✓. Cash increased from $59,299.64 → $67,471.84 (+$8,172.20 = 20 × $408.61 proceeds) ✓.

- **LLY** ($1,104.79, **+3.0% from entry $1,072.944**, **+2.1% today**) ✓ — Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis playing out. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($70.60 buffer, 6.4%). Thesis STRONGEST in portfolio.
- **MSFT** ($430.14, **+1.9% from entry $422.31**, **+0.5% today**) ✓ — Azure AI secular thesis intact. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($10.45 buffer, 2.5%).
- **NVDA** ($214.65, **−0.8% from entry $216.302**, **−0.1% today**) ✓ — AVGO sympathy selling did NOT trigger NVDA stop at open. Price $214.65 vs stop $209.052 — buffer $5.60 (2.6%). HWM $232.28. Thesis intact (AI accelerator monopoly). Ex-div credit $7.50 expected today or next business day.

## 2026-06-03 15:53 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal

- **META** ($622.32, +0.27% from entry $620.637, **+4.13% today**) ✓ — Strong recovery. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329. META came to within $2.49 of its HWM but did not exceed it — no ratchet. Thesis validating. Dividend June 25 ($7.875).
- **LLY** ($1,082.53, +0.89% from entry $1,072.944, **+1.73% today**) ✓ — Solid day. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($48.34 above current). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis intact.
- **MSFT** ($428.25, +1.41% from entry $422.31, **−2.96% today**) ✓ — Continued Build conference "sell the news" pullback. HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($8.56 above current). Thesis intact — Azure AI secular growth story unchanged.
- **NVDA** ($215.665, −0.29% from entry $216.302, **−3.21% today**) ✓ — **EX-DIVIDEND TODAY.** 30sh × USD 0.25 = USD 7.50 credit. Price decline −3.21% is predominantly market-driven AI softness, not the dividend (which is only ~0.11% dilution on price). HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($6.61 above current). Thesis intact.
- **Trailing stops — all 5 confirmed active (verified via Alpaca open orders):**
  - AVGO (a8e344f4): HWM $495.00, stop $445.50 ✓ — unchanged
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ✓ — unchanged

- **Today P/L:** −$166.60 (−0.16% vs June 2 close $101,117.57). META +4.13% ($370.35) and LLY +1.73% ($128.66) were positives; MSFT −2.96% (−$261.20) and NVDA −3.21% (−$214.65) were drags. AVGO +0.76% (+$73.60) offset partially.

- **Since inception:** Bull +0.95% vs SPY +2.08% = **−1.13%** gap (improved from −1.23% at midday; META recovery closed the gap slightly).
- **Note:** Session characterized by rotation within the portfolio. META had its best single-day since entry (+4.13%), nearly recovering to its all-time high in our book ($624.81). MSFT continues the anticipated "sell the news" pattern from the Build conference — now −7.7% from its Build Day 1 high but still $8.56 above its stop. NVDA ex-dividend day — the $7.50 credit will appear in account. AVGO held steady ahead of tonight's pivotal earnings print. No positions triggered any guardrail today. All stops intact.
- **AVGO earnings TONIGHT (after close):** Scale plan for June 4 open — see portfolio.md. This is the decisive event for the week.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining. AMZN close does NOT consume a slot (exits are not new positions).

## 2026-06-03 12:33 ET — MIDDAY CHECK — SELL AMZN
- **Action:** SELL 30 shares AMZN (market order) — −7% cut rule triggered
- **Fill:** 30 shares @ $249.21 avg (order id: 35f52817-62dc-4c02-a41a-d36048f8b9e9) — filled immediately
- **Why:** AMZN hit $249.23 at 12:33 ET, breaching the −7% cut threshold of $250.29 (entry $269.13 × 0.93). Rule is mechanical: no discretion. The position had drifted lower over 6 consecutive sessions driven by European cloud regulatory headwinds, AWS talent concerns, and heavy capex cycle. While the long-term AWS thesis ($364B backlog, Prime Day June 23–26) remained intact, the thesis was failing to hold price above the protective level. Capital is better protected and redeployed on a fresh entry with better R/R than riding a positional loser below the guardrail.
- **Stop:** Trailing stop (bbcd70fa) CANCELED prior to close — confirmed canceled in orders. No orphaned orders.
- **Loss:** 30sh × ($249.21 − $269.13) = −$597.60 (−7.39%). Proceeds ~$7,476.30 returned to cash.
- **Verified:** AMZN absent from positions re-fetch ✓. AMZN trailing stop (bbcd70fa) confirmed canceled ✓. 5 positions remain.

  - LLY ($1,087.40, +1.35% from entry $1,072.944) — well above −7% cut. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19. ✓

- **Account:** Equity $100,990.59 | Cash $51,823.36 (51.3%) | Long market value $49,167.23
- **AVGO** ($478.72, +14.71% from entry $417.37, **−0.36% today**) ✓ — **Broker ratcheted HWM to $495.00 at open** (up from $488.82; AVGO hit intraday high $495.00 at the open bell), **stop ratcheted to $445.50** (up from $439.938). Currently pulling back intraday from the $495 open high. EARNINGS TONIGHT June 3 after close (5 PM ET). DO NOT ADD. Post-earnings scale plan remains: if Q2 AI semiconductor revenue BEATS $10.7B guide AND Q3 AI guidance raised >$11.5B → add 8–10 shares at June 4 open.
- **MSFT** ($435.42, +3.10% from entry $422.31, **−1.34% today**) ✓ — Build Day 2 in progress (Autopilots, Copilot desktop, Azure AI Foundry, Aion 1.0). HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ($15.73 above current). Thesis intact — thesis continues to strengthen.
- **META** ($611.40, −1.49% from entry $620.637, **+2.13% today**) ✓ — Recovering strongly today. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ($48.07 above current). AI ad thesis intact.
- **LLY** ($1,066.10, −0.64% from entry $1,072.94, **−0.01% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($31.91 above current). Thesis intact (Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1).
- **AMZN** ($256.135, −4.84% from entry $269.13, **−0.19% today**) ⚠️ WATCH — Soft again. Cut threshold $250.29 ($5.84 above current). Stop $247.275 ($8.86 above current). **Midday check critical: close AMZN if price < $250.29 per −7% rule.**
- **NVDA** ($219.32, +1.41% from entry $216.302, **−1.56% today**) ✓ — **EX-DIVIDEND TODAY** ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit). Price down intraday partly reflecting ex-div adjustment. HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($10.27 above current). Normal. Credit expected today or next business day.
- **Trailing stops — all 6 confirmed active (verified via Alpaca open orders):**

  - NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged
- **Guardrail check:** No position below −7% cut threshold (worst: AMZN −4.84%). AVGO +15% tighten rule: at +14.71% — just below trigger, and WAIVED regardless (earnings tonight). All stops active. Cash 51.3% > 5%. Week: 1/3 positions used. No action warranted.
- **SPY:** $757.72 at 09:37 ET. Since inception: Bull +0.99% vs SPY +2.47% = **−1.48%** gap. (Equity declined ~$127 from yesterday's close of $101,117.57 — broad softness at open, AVGO giving back pre-market gains, MSFT continuing Build Day 2 pullback.)
- **Today's plan:** No trades. Hold all 6 positions. AVGO earnings after close tonight is the week's pivotal event. AMZN midday cut threshold $250.29 remains the active risk management trigger.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining.

## 2026-06-02 15:51 ET — CLOSE (no trades)
- **Action:** None — end-of-day P/L check and journal
- **Market status:** `is_open: true`, next close 16:00 ET (confirmed via clock)
- **Account:** Equity $101,117.57 | Cash $51,823.36 (51.3%) | Long market value $49,294.21
- **AVGO** ($479.39, +14.86% from entry $417.37, **+4.22% today**) ✓ — Intraday HWM $488.82 (broker ratcheted), stop $439.938. At close AVGO is $0.60 below the +15% tighten rule ($479.98) — tighten rule waived regardless (AVGO earnings TONIGHT June 3 after close). Plan: if AI revenue >$5B + guidance raised → scale to 12–14% at June 4 open. DO NOT ADD before print.
- **MSFT** ($441.63, +4.57% from entry $422.31, **-4.10% today**) ✓ — Severe "sell the news" on Build Day 1 (from $460.52 June 1 close to $441.63). HWM $466.32, stop $419.688. MSFT is $22 above stop — safe. Build Day 2 tomorrow. Thesis (Azure AI +40%, Copilot enterprise moat) intact.
- **META** ($600.37, -3.27% from entry $620.64, **-0.02% today**) ✓ — Essentially flat today. HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 unchanged.
- **LLY** ($1,067.99, -0.46% from entry $1,072.94, **-1.31% today**) ✓ — Mild drift. HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 unchanged.
- **AMZN** ($257.70, -4.25% from entry $269.13, **-1.36% today**) ⚠️ WATCH — Cut threshold $250.29 ($7.40 above it). Stop $247.275 ($10.43 above current). Fourth consecutive down session. Thesis intact but price action persistently soft. **Tomorrow midday: close if AMZN < $250.29.**
- **NVDA** ($222.14, +2.70% from entry $216.302, **-0.99% today**) ✓ — HWM $232.28, stop $209.052. **Ex-dividend TOMORROW June 3** ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit).
- **Trailing stops — all 6 confirmed active:**
  - AVGO (a8e344f4): HWM $488.82 (ratcheted intraday), stop $439.938 ✓
  - MSFT (a55a3db6): HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 ✓ — unchanged
  - META (4ea07e91): HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ✓ — unchanged

  - NVDA (8c6b9680): HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ✓ — unchanged
- **Today P/L:** −$266.64 (−0.26%). MSFT −4.10% was primary drag; AVGO +4.22% was primary offset.
- **SPY:** $759.40 (+0.10% today). Bull underperformed SPY by −0.36% today.
- **Since inception:** Bull +1.12% vs SPY +2.70% = **−1.58%** gap (widened from −1.25% at midday; cash drag 51.3% is structural driver).
- **Note:** Today's dominant story was MSFT Build Day 1 "sell the news" — the stock gave back −4.10% as expected, from $460.52 to $441.63. This is the most severe single-day drop for MSFT in our portfolio but was explicitly anticipated in pre-market research ("classic sell the news"). Stop at $419.688 is $22 below current price — well protected. AVGO had a strong session (+4.22%, intraday high $488.82 ratcheting the stop) heading into tonight's earnings. The AVGO print is the week's pivotal event — a strong beat (AI revenue >$5B, guidance raised) unlocks the June 4 scale-up plan. AMZN is the portfolio's concern: four consecutive soft sessions, now −4.25% from entry with only $7.40 of margin above the −7% midday cut rule. NVDA ex-div tomorrow ($7.50 credit). No positions triggered any guardrail today.
- **Week of June 1:** 1/3 positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining. No trades today.

- **AVGO** ($483.01, +15.73% from entry $417.37) ✓ — **Qualifies for +15% stop tightening rule, but WAIVED.** Earnings TOMORROW June 3 after close; tightening from 10% to 7% (stop ~$454.60) risks being triggered on earnings-night volatility and would undermine the planned post-earnings scale-up. Existing 10% stop (HWM $488.82, stop $439.938) already locks in +5.4% from entry if triggered. HWM unchanged — AVGO intraday at $483 is below $488.82 HWM. DO NOT ADD before earnings.

- **MSFT:** $460.78 vs entry $422.31 → **+9.11%** (+2.34% today) ✓ — HWM $466.32, stop $419.688 unchanged. Build conference June 2–3.

- **META:** $603.49 vs entry $620.637 → **−2.76%** (−4.59% vs prior close $632.51) ✓ — HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 unchanged. New position first-day softness; thesis intact.
- **AMZN:** $261.92 vs entry $269.13 → **−2.68%** (−3.22% today) ✓ — HWM $274.75, stop $247.275 unchanged. Soft; AWS thesis intact.

- **Since inception:** Bull +1.37% vs SPY +2.60% = **−1.23%** gap (widened from −1.07% Friday; cash drag primary driver at 51% cash).
- **Note:** Mixed close session. NVDA led (+5.47% — Computex RTX Spark enthusiasm continued to EOD, new HWM $222.694, stop ratcheted to $200.42). MSFT (+2.34%) and AVGO (+2.53%) both strong ahead of key catalysts (Build conference June 2–3 for MSFT, earnings June 3 for AVGO). META had a rough first day (−4.59% from prior session's $632.51 close; −2.76% from our entry $620.64) — early softness is normal for a new position and the AI advertising thesis remains intact. AMZN soft (−3.22%) and LLY pulled back mildly (−2.03% — possible "buy the rumour, sell the news" on CVS Foundayo launch today). All 6 positions remain well above −7% cut threshold. No trailing stop was triggered. AVGO earnings June 3 is the pivotal week event — position held, DO NOT ADD before print.

- **Portfolio equity:** $101,109.60 (new equity high) | Cash: $61,132.91 (60.5%)
- **Note:** Strong open driven by MSFT (+2.88% — four consecutive strong sessions; Azure AI thesis intact) and AVGO (+2.64% — ahead of June 3 earnings, analysts bullish). Both trailing stops ratcheted materially: MSFT HWM $429.49→$439.87 (+$10.38), AVGO HWM $435.31→$439.52 (+$4.21).

COST earnings missed strong-beat criteria (EPS $4.93 vs $5.10 threshold). Final weekly slot (1 of 3) carried to week of June 1. Candidates: META (ad-tech AI flywheel) or LLY scale-up post-AVGO earnings June 3. Do not rush.
