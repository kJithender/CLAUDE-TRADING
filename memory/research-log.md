### Macro (pre-market June 19, 2026 ~08:03 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Market | **CLOSED — Juneteenth holiday (June 19, 2026)** | — | Next open June 22 |
| 10yr Treasury yield | **4.44%** (June 18 close per Fed H.15; fell from 4.49% post-FOMC) | <4.75% | ✓ GATE PASSES — below trigger |
| S&P 500 futures | **~7,498** (futures constructive heading into June 22) | — | ✓ Constructive; broad risk-on tone |
| FOMC | COMPLETED June 17 — rate hold 3.50–3.75%; hawkish dot plot (9/18 project hike) | — | ✓ Done; 10yr monitored |
| Iran/US peace deal | Signed at Versailles June 18 (formal agreement) | Oil <$100 | ✓ Constructive for equities |
| SPY ex-dividend | June 18 — $1.76/sh applied; total-return anchor $741.20 | — | ✓ Already updated |
| Juneteenth | Federal holiday; NYSE + bond market closed June 19 | — | Routine proceeds; plan for Monday |

**Macro posture: MODERATELY CONSTRUCTIVE heading into June 22.** Peace deal signed, FOMC completed, 10yr falling (4.44% — below 4.75% trigger). SPY futures constructive. All macro gates clear for Monday buys. FOMC overhang is resolved; only ongoing risk is hawkish dot-plot implication for rate path in H2 2026, which the 10yr gate at 4.75% manages.

### Step 3b: Thesis contract review (June 19)

**LLY:**
- Invalidation: stop fires ($1,064.457) or Medicare Bridge reversed
- review_by: **July 1 — 12 DAYS AWAY** (approaching — explicit decision required at pre-market June 30)
- Current $1,098.57 >> stop $1,064.457 (buffer $34.11 = 3.11%). Buffer has narrowed on recent pullback. Monitor.
- News: 4E Therapeutics acquisition (June 16 — neuroscience/non-addictive painkillers). Retatrutide trial completed. Cathie Wood (ARK) purchased 41,000 shares — positive institutional sentiment signal. Germany investment reduction noted. No negative GLP-1 catalysts.
- **What changed since yesterday:** Cathie Wood/ARK added 41K shares — positive sentiment. No negative catalyst.
- **Decision: HOLD. Medicare Bridge July 1 in 12 days — this is the primary catalyst. Thesis intact. Explicit hold/trim/exit decision required at pre-market June 30.**

**V:**
- Invalidation: stop fires ($303.138) or regulatory mandate forces open access
- review_by: July 28 (39 days)
- Current $327.24 >> stop $303.138 (buffer $24.10 = 7.37%)
- News: OpenAI/agentic payments, stablecoin/token capabilities (Payments Forum). 36 analysts Strong Buy, avg PT $398.83 (21.9% upside). Cross-border slowdown noted (monitoring; not thesis-breaking). July 28 earnings upcoming.
- **What changed since yesterday:** No material new catalysts over the holiday. Thesis intact.
- **Decision: HOLD. July 28 earnings is next gate. Thesis intact.**

**VST:** ⭐⭐
- Invalidation: stop fires ($153.297) or WTI >$100 or FCF guidance cut or Helix cancellation
- review_by: July 7 (18 days)
- Current $163.75 >> stop $153.297 (buffer $10.45 = 6.38%)
- News: Cogentrix acquisition complete (5,500 MW, $4.0B). Helix Digital Infrastructure (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait) intact. Morgan Stanley raised PT to $212 (from $208), Overweight. Avg analyst PT $188.44. **DIVIDEND EX-DATE MONDAY JUNE 22** — $0.229/sh × 40sh = USD 9.16; payment date June 30.
- **What changed since yesterday:** VST thesis continues to strengthen. Peace deal formally signed — constructive energy backdrop. Analyst PT raised.
- **Decision: STRONG HOLD. Dividend ex-date Monday — market-open routine must confirm $9.16 credit timing (appears in account June 30 on payment date). Position buffer 6.38% — adequate but watch VST price at Monday open for stop ratchet potential.**

---

### Step 3c: Monday conviction-weighted holding review (REQUIRED — June 22 is Monday, this is the Friday preview)

Effective Monday June 22:

| Symbol | Rating | Rationale | 3-C-counter |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| LLY | **A** | Medicare Bridge July 1 in 12 days; thesis intact; Cathie Wood buying; stop buffer 3.11% (narrowed — worth monitoring) | N/A |
| V | **B** | Working but flat (1.13% from entry); thesis intact; cross-border slowdown monitoring; no C flag | 0/3 weeks C |
| VST | **A** | Cogentrix + Helix; +10.04% from entry; dividend Monday; analyst PT upgrades | N/A |

No position rated C. No mandatory trims. V continues B — tracking toward July 28 earnings catalyst.

### Watchlist evaluation

**NVDA ($210.38 June 18 close; AH ~$209.97):** ⭐ **PRIORITY BUY FOR MONDAY**
- **Price gate:** June 18 close $210.38 — **PASSES** (above $205 threshold ✓). After failing the gate in the June 18 pre-market ($204.70 June 17 close), NVDA rallied convincingly on June 18.
- **ATR check:**
  - June 17: H=209.20, L=203.47, C=204.70 → Range 5.73, ATR% = 2.80% ✓
  - June 18: H=211.39, L=206.50, C=210.38 → Range 4.89, ATR% = 2.32% ✓
  - 2-session average ATR: **2.56% ≤ 3%** ✓ (both sessions qualify individually)
- **News:** $25B multi-tranche debt offering completed June 18 (large but signals confidence in growth capex). SLB partnership deepened. NVDA Ecosystem ETF debuted. Helix Digital Infrastructure (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait) thesis intact. Deutsche Bank PT raised to $220.
- **Earnings window:** Aug 26, 68 days ✓.
- **Thesis:** AI accelerator monopoly; Helix consortium embeds GPU demand in AI infrastructure platform; FY2026 data center revenue +92% YoY; 62 analysts Strong Buy; avg PT $298.93 (+42% upside from $210).
- **Entry signals (3+ required):** Earnings momentum ✓ (Q1 FY27 blowout); Catalyst ✓ (Helix, AI infrastructure cycle); Valuation OK (premium but monopoly justified); Technical ✓ (above $205 base, ATR normalizing); Macro tailwind ✓ (AI capex continues). **5/5 signals.**
- **Sizing:**
  - Risk budget: 1.2% × $99,039 = $1,188 loss max
  - 10% trailing stop → max position $11,880; NVDA at ~$210 → 56 shares max by risk budget
  - Starter conviction (7%): 7% × $99,039 = $6,933 / $210 = **33 shares = $6,930 = 7.0% of portfolio** ✓
  - Risk at 33sh: 33 × $210 × 10% = $693 = 0.70% of equity ✓ (well within 1.2% budget)
  - 20% cap: 20% × $99,039 = $19,808 / $210 = 94sh — far from cap ✓
  - Post-trade cash: $74,304 − $6,930 = $67,374 = **68%** (well above 5% minimum ✓)
  - Post-trade total deployment: 7.0% ≤ 25% daily cap ✓
- **ATR volatility check (playbook step 7):** 2-session avg ATR 2.56% — below 3% threshold. Full size appropriate. No halving required.
- **Decision: PLAN BUY Monday June 22 open — 33 shares NVDA at market (~$210). Place 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.**

**LRCX ($388.86 June 18 close):** DEFERRED — ATR 3.54% (June 18) ❌
- June 17 ATR 6.19%, June 18 ATR 3.54% — both above 3%. Improving but still disqualified.
- Citi raised PT to $450 (from $315) — significant upgrade. Thesis intact.
- Need 3 consecutive sessions at ≤3%. Earliest possible entry: week of June 29 if ATR normalizes.
- **Decision: NO BUY. Re-evaluate each pre-market next week if ATR drops to ≤3%.**

**PWR ($702.54 June 18 close):** DEFERRED — ATR 3.97% (June 18) ❌
- June 17 ATR 2.28%, June 18 ATR 3.97% — elevated on June 18 (down −1.71% on day after conference).
- Insider selling $123.2M in 3 months (worth monitoring as a caution flag). P/E ~95 is elevated.
- 30-day pullback −10.78% from peak — stock is in a correction from conference highs.
- **Decision: NO BUY. ATR elevated; stock in pullback; insider selling notable. Re-evaluate when ATR calms and stock stabilizes above support. PWR remains a valid thesis but needs better entry setup.**

---

### Cash-drag check
Cash: 74.97% — significantly above 25–40% target. Week of June 22 is the first week with a clear, qualified entry (NVDA). Planning 1 position = ~7% deployment. Still heavy in cash but deploying into the highest-conviction qualified name. NVDA is not a forced entry — it satisfies all 5 entry criteria. Holding the remaining 2 slots for LRCX (when ATR qualifies) and PWR (when ATR/setup calms). Cash deployment is progressing; not rushing.

---

### VST dividend note (CRITICAL for market-open June 22)
VST ex-dividend date: **Monday June 22, 2026**. Market-open routine must:
1. Note the ex-dividend price adjustment (~$0.229/sh drop in open price — VST may open slightly lower than June 18 close $163.75)
2. The trailing stop (HWM $170.33, stop $153.297) remains unchanged through ex-dividend — stop protects against downside regardless of dividend adjustment
3. Dividend payment (USD $9.16 for 40sh) credited to account on **June 30** (payment date)
4. Stop audit: confirm c4c200a5 remains active after ex-dividend open

### Performance vs S&P 500 (pre-market June 19)

| Period | Bull | SPY | Difference |
|--------|------|-----|------------|
| Inception (2026-05-21) | $99,039.61 = **−0.960%** | $741.20 anchor + ~$6.27 est. Jun 22+ = **+1.323% total-return** | **Bull TRAILS SPY ~2.28pp** |

_Note: SPY last close June 18 was $747.47. Total return anchor $741.20. Gap unchanged from EOD June 18 (−2.25pp) as market is closed today._

---

### Planned trades for Monday June 22, 2026

## 2026-06-18 — Pre-market research (~08:03 ET)

**Today is Thursday June 18. Week of June 16: 0/3 new positions used. Post-FOMC gate LIFTED. SPY ex-dividend TODAY ($1.76/sh) — anchor updates to $741.20. 10yr at 4.49% — BELOW 4.75% gate — new buys permitted if individual candidate gates clear.**

### Macro (pre-market June 18, 2026 ~08:03 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 10yr Treasury yield | **4.49%** (June 17 close; Alpaca/search confirmed) | <4.75% | ✓ GATE PASSES — new buys permitted |
| S&P 500 futures | **+0.87%** (pre-market rebound after digesting hawkish FOMC) | — | Constructive |
| FOMC | **COMPLETED June 17** — rate hold 3.50–3.75%; dot plot hawkish (median 3.8% year-end, up from 3.4%) | — | ✓ Done; 10yr gate operative |
| SPY ex-dividend | **TODAY June 18 — $1.76/sh** — total-return anchor updates: $739.44 → **$741.20** | — | Benchmark update applied |
| Iran/US peace deal | Continuing; WTI ~$80/bbl | Oil <$100 | ✓ |
| Import prices May | +1.9% (fuel/lubricants +12.5%), export prices +1.3% — 6th straight monthly rise | — | Note: mild inflationary pressure; 10yr held below trigger |
| SPY pre-market | **$744.55** (Alpaca latest trade 08:03 ET, up from $741.02 June 17 Alpaca daily close) | — | +0.48% from close |

**Macro posture: MODERATELY CONSTRUCTIVE.** 10yr gate passes at 4.49%. Hawkish dot plot is a known risk for high-multiple names but has not pushed 10yr above the trigger. Continued discipline required on entries. Rebound today consistent with post-FOMC digestion.

- **What changed since yesterday:** Cogentrix acquisition CLOSED in June 2026 — Vistra added 5,500 MW of modern natural gas capacity ($4.0B net: $2.3B cash + $0.9B stock + $1.5B debt). Announced Dec 31 2025, regulatory approvals cleared, closed on schedule. This dramatically expands VST's generation portfolio for AI hyperscaler power demand. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan reiterate Overweight, raised PTs. Avg analyst PT $225.29 (+40% upside from current $160.91).
- Dividend ex-date June 22 in **4 days** — USD 9.16 credit ($0.229/sh × 40sh).

### Watchlist evaluation

**NVDA ($204.70 close June 17; pre-market ~$202–205):**
- Entry gate: "basing above $205 with ATR ≤3%"
- ATR check (2-day sample): June 17 range $203.47–$209.20 = $5.73, close $204.70 → ATR% = 2.80% ≤3% ✓
- **Price gate: FAILS** — June 17 close $204.70 is $0.30 below $205. Pre-market reportedly as low as $202.17. Stock is NOT basing above $205; it is drifting through it.
- Next earnings Aug 26 (69 days) ✓. No earnings window.
- **Decision: NO BUY. Price gate fails. Need NVDA to close convincingly above $205 and hold for 1+ session before entry is valid. Re-evaluate June 19+ if stock re-establishes above $205.**

**LRCX ($374.40 close June 17; pre-market reportedly ~$392):**
- ATR check: June 17 range $373.86–$397.05 = $23.19, close $374.40 → ATR% = **6.19% — DISQUALIFIED (>3%).**
- June 16 ATR: range $368.82–$392.825 = $24.005, close $369.37 → ATR% = **6.50%.**
- Pre-market gap to $392 (+4.7%) suggests intraday volatility will remain elevated today.
- **Decision: NO BUY. ATR ~6% — well above 3% gate. Must see ≤3% for 3+ consecutive sessions before entry. Not a near-term candidate.**

**PWR ($714.75 close June 17; pre-market ~$728):**
- ATR check: June 17 range $708.36–$724.69 = $16.33, close $714.75 → ATR% = 2.28% ✓
- June 16 ATR: range $719.34–$737.88 = $18.54, close $719.34 → ATR% = 2.58% ✓
- ATR PASSES. Next earnings July 30 (42 days) ✓.
- TD Cowen conference: **June 17 (YESTERDAY)** — condition "post-conference volatility settled" not yet met. Pre-market up $8.71 (+1.2%) = still in conference momentum window.
- Entry signals review: Earnings momentum ✓ (Q1 EPS +31.4%, rev +26.3%); Catalyst ✓ (AI grid/power demand, $4.7B backlog expansion); Valuation likely ✓ (PEG ~1.67 at 30%+ growth / ~50x P/E); Technical uncertain (need 50-day MA position); Macro tailwind ✓ — 3+ signals likely met.
- **Decision: NO BUY TODAY. Conference was yesterday; price still in conference-momentum window. Re-evaluate June 19+ once 1–2 sessions of stable price action confirm the post-conference base. PWR is the priority entry if NVDA fails to reclaim $205.**

---

### Cash-drag check
Cash: 74.96% — significantly above 25–40% target band. Week slots: 0/3 used. Tape is constructive (+0.87%). **Explicit reasoning for no entry today:** All three primary candidates fail specific gates: (1) NVDA below $205 price threshold; (2) LRCX ATR 6.2% — disqualified; (3) PWR conference ended yesterday — price not yet settled. Staying in cash today is the correct outcome — not a passive default. All gates are documented. NVDA and PWR are positioned for June 19+ entry once conditions normalize. Deploying into failing gates guarantees compressed stop buffers and suboptimal fills.

**Today is Wednesday June 17. Week of June 16: 0/3 new positions used. FOMC ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY at 2 PM ET (⚠️ MEMORY CORRECTION: prior entries said "June 18" — June 17 IS Wednesday, announcement is TODAY). Gate lifts at 2 PM ET today. No new positions before then.**

### Macro (pre-market June 17, 2026 ~08:03 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S&P 500 futures / SPY pre-mkt | **+0.28%** (modestly higher ahead of FOMC decision) | — | ✓ Constructive; awaiting FOMC |
| FOMC June 16–17 | **DAY 2 — announcement TODAY 2 PM ET** (Kevin Warsh's first meeting; rate hold 97% probability; CME FedWatch 0.6% implied hike probability) | Announcement TODAY June 17 2 PM ET | ⚠️ GATE ACTIVE until 2 PM ET today |
| Dot plot (SEP) | Expected to eliminate single projected cut; up to 3 FOMC members may project rate hikes; Warsh may withhold his own dot (opposed to forward guidance) | 10yr <4.75% | ⚠️ Key risk at 2 PM ET — watch 10yr |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.47% (June 16 est.) | <4.75% | ✓ Below trigger — watch post-dot-plot |
| Iran/US peace deal | Still advancing; WTI ~$80/bbl; Strait of Hormuz reopening | Oil <$100 | ✓ Constructive |
| SPY pre-market | $750.61 (latest trade 08:01 AM ET; vs June 16 Alpaca close $750.58) | — | ~flat overnight |
| SPY yesterday close | $750.58 (Alpaca daily bar, June 16) | — | Note: post-FOMC SPY direction key |

**⚠️ MEMORY CORRECTION (material):** All prior memory files stated "FOMC announcement Wednesday June 18 2 PM ET." This is wrong — June 17 IS Wednesday (June 18 is Thursday). The announcement is TODAY June 17 at 2:00 PM ET; Warsh press conference 2:30 PM ET. Correcting this record. Gate lifts TODAY at 2 PM ET, not tomorrow.

**SPY ex-dividend TOMORROW June 18 (Thursday):** $1.76/sh. After June 18, SPY total-return anchor adjusts: $739.44 + $1.76 = $741.20 (effective anchor for post-June 18 benchmarking). This will narrow the reported gap by ~0.238pp.

**Macro posture: CAUTIOUS HOLD, FOMC ANNOUNCEMENT IMMINENT.** Futures modestly higher (+0.28%) as market expects a neutral rate hold but watches Warsh's dot plot and press conference closely. Warsh is known to oppose forward guidance — he may withhold his own dot entirely, reducing Fed predictability. Risk is hawkish surprise (dot plot shifts to no cuts + multiple hike signals). 10yr yield at ~4.47% below the 4.75% halt trigger for now. **Hard gate: NO new positions before 2 PM ET today (FOMC announcement).**

### Held positions (pre-market June 17, 2026 — live Alpaca prices)

**LLY ($1,119.06 pre-mkt, −0.31% today from $1,122.50 June 16 close, +2.33% from avg entry $1,093.534):** ⭐ STRONG
- **What changed since yesterday:** Phase 3 TRIUMPH-1 retatrutide trial data: average weight loss 28.3% of body weight (70.3 lbs) over 80 weeks — comparable to bariatric surgery outcomes. Barclays Buy rating June 15 confirmed. AJX-101 Phase 1 data June 14 (pipeline diversification). Q1 2026 EPS $8.55 beat estimates by 24.82%. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge effective July 1 in **14 days** — thesis catalyst approaching. No negative catalysts.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 6, 2026 — 50 days away ✓ (well outside 2-day window)
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.457) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by = July 1 (14 days). Current $1,119.06 >> $1,064.457. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $1,119.06 − $1,064.457 = **$54.60 (4.88%)** ✓ Adequate (LLY currently below HWM $1,182.73, so stop remains at $1,064.457).
- **Decision: HOLD. TRIUMPH-1 data reinforces GLP-1 leadership. Medicare Bridge 14 days away. Thesis strongest in portfolio.**

**V ($332.52 pre-mkt, −0.18% today from $333.12 June 16 close, +2.77% from avg entry $323.57):** ✓ INTACT
- **What changed since yesterday:** No material new catalysts overnight. Visa-OpenAI integration announced June 10 (AI agent-driven transactions). AI/stablecoin capabilities at Payments Forum confirmed. Mild pre-market weakness consistent with FOMC-day caution on financials. Stock trading at $332.52 — analysts see 24.6% undervaluation, avg PT $398.83.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings July 28, 2026 — 41 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = trailing stop fires ($299.772) or regulatory mandate forces open access. review_by = July 28. Current $332.52 >> $299.772. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $332.52 − $299.772 = **$32.75 (9.85%)** ✓ Healthy. Note: V is near HWM $333.08 — if it trades above $333.08 today, stop ratchets.
- **Decision: HOLD. Flat performance in pre-market; FOMC-day caution on financials is temporary. OpenAI integration is direct thesis confirmation. Near HWM — watch for ratchet.**

**VST ($160.05 pre-mkt, +0.91% today from $158.61 June 16 close, +7.55% from avg entry $148.81):** ⭐⭐ HELIX — STRONG
- **What changed since yesterday:** Helix Digital Infrastructure (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait) thesis intact and strengthening. Vistra +12.3% in past month driven by AI power demand. Dividend ex-date **June 22 in 5 days** ($0.229/sh × 40sh = USD 9.16 credit). Quarterly dividend declared: $0.2290/sh payable June 30. Analyst avg PT $188.44. PJM capacity auction results were positive (VST announced strong results). No negative catalysts.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 6, 2026 — 50 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = WTI >$100 (NO — ~$80 ✓), FCF guidance cut (NO ✓), PPA/Helix cancellation (NO — Helix strengthening ✓), breaks $130 on volume (NO — $160.05 ✓). review_by = July 7 (20 days). **THESIS INTACT AND STRENGTHENED.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $160.05 − $145.332 = **$14.72 (9.19%)** ✓ Strong — near-full 10% trailing protection. VST trading below HWM $161.48; if it trades above $161.48 today, stop ratchets.
- **Decision: HOLD. Dividend ex-date June 22 in 5 days. Helix thesis is the strongest fundamental upgrade in portfolio. PJM auction results positive.**

### Post-FOMC candidate research (reference for today 2 PM+ and Thursday June 18+)

**Slot 1 — LRCX (Lam Research): ATR STILL ELEVATED — DEFER**
- June 16 close: $369.34 (down ~5.03% on the day) — daily range still ~5%, above 3% threshold ❌
- Pattern: June 11 ~7.81%, June 12 ~5.01%, June 15 ~5.90%, June 16 ~5.03% — gradually declining but still far above 3%
- **Ex-dividend TODAY June 17:** $0.26/sh quarterly dividend — minor (~0.07% of price)
- **Next earnings:** August 5, 2026 — 49 days away ✓
- Analyst thesis intact: UBS PT $375, Oppenheimer $400, Cantor $425; WFE market now $140B; advanced packaging >50% growth 2026
- Entry condition: Need ATR ≤3% for 3+ consecutive sessions. Most optimistic scenario: if session June 17 and June 18 are both calm (<3% range), entry eligible Thursday June 19+ or Friday June 20+
- **Post-FOMC check (2 PM today):** If FOMC neutral and LRCX settles, check Thursday pre-market ATR

**Slot 2 — NVDA (Nvidia): IN BUY ZONE — post-FOMC eligible**
- June 16 close: $207.41; pre-market June 17 predicted ~$208.75 — above $205 re-entry threshold ✓
- **Next earnings:** August 25–26, 2026 (~69 days) ✓ Well outside window
- 62 analysts Strong Buy, avg PT $298.93 (+44% upside from current price)
- FY2026 revenue $215.94B (+65% YoY); data center revenue +92% — AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact
- Helix consortium (KKR+NVIDIA+VST) validates GPU demand for AI infrastructure
- **Post-FOMC check (2 PM today):** If FOMC neutral, NVDA above $205 with ATR normalizing → plan Thursday entry
- Sizing: 10-11 shares (~$210 × 11 = $2,310 or ~$210 × 15 = $3,150; target 7-9% of portfolio ≈ ~$7K = 33sh; risk budget 1.2% of $99K = $1,188 loss / 10% stop = $11,880 position = ~56sh but cap at 12%)

Actually, let me recalculate NVDA sizing:
- Risk budget: 1.2% of $99,212 = $1,190 loss max
- With 10% trailing stop: position size = $1,190 / 10% = $11,900 max
- NVDA at $208: $11,900 / $208 = ~57sh (rounds to 57sh at 12% portfolio — at the cap with full risk budget)
- Starter position (7-9%): 7% × $99,212 = $6,945 / $208 = ~33sh
- 20% hard cap: $19,842 / $208 = ~95sh
- Risk budget at 33sh: 33 × $208 × 10% = $686 loss = 0.69% of equity (within 1.2% limit) ✓
- **Target: 33 shares at ~$208 = ~$6,864 = 6.9% of portfolio** (starter conviction, within risk budget)

**Slot 3 — PWR (Quanta Services): MOVING UP — post-FOMC eligible**
- June 17 pre-market: $718.88–$737.82 range (conference day); latest $722 est.
- **Institutional investor presentations:** TD Cowen Conference TODAY June 17 in Toronto
- **Next earnings:** July 30, 2026 — 43 days away ✓ (well outside 2-day window)
- Q1 2026 adj EPS $2.68 (+50.6% YoY); revenue $7.87B (+26.4% YoY); record backlog $48.5B
- Raised 2026 guidance. Analyst avg PT $761.35 (4.47% upside from $722).
- Post-conference volatility possible today — wait for dust to settle before planning entry
- **Post-FOMC timing:** If TD Cowen presentation today is constructive and ATR calms, PWR eligible for Thursday/Friday entry post-gate

### Cash-drag explicit decision (June 17)

Cash at 74.89% — above strategy target 25-40%. Explicit reasoning for holding:
1. **FOMC gate active through 2 PM ET TODAY** — announcement in ~6 hours; hawkish dot plot risk remains
2. **LRCX ATR ~5%** — still disqualified per volatility rule; entry needs 3+ consecutive ≤3% sessions
3. **NVDA above $205** — re-entry zone reached, but FOMC gate still active at market open; wait for 2 PM announcement
4. **PWR conference today** — TD Cowen presentation may cause intraday volatility; wait for settling
5. **Current positions (LLY, V, VST)** — all healthy with intact/strengthened theses; no urgency to force additional deployment before rate clarity

**Post-FOMC (from 2 PM ET today):**
Close routine will assess FOMC outcome and plan Thursday June 18 deployment if neutral/in-line:
- Priority 1: NVDA (33sh, above $205, ATR check at Thursday pre-market)
- Priority 2: LRCX (if ATR finally reaches ≤3% by Thursday)
- Priority 3: PWR (after conference volatility settles)

---

### Performance (pre-market June 17, 2026)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $99,212.67 (−0.787% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY pre-mkt (latest trade):** $750.61 (vs anchor $739.44 = **+1.510% since inception**)
- **Estimated gap:** Bull −0.787% vs SPY +1.510% = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~2.30pp**
- Note: After SPY ex-div June 18 ($1.76/sh), SPY total-return anchor becomes $741.20 — will narrow reported gap by ~0.238pp (effective gap ~2.06pp vs adjusted anchor).
- **Pre-market P/L (unrealized, vs last_equity):** LLY −$34.40 (−0.31%), V −$13.20 (−0.18%), VST +$57.60 (+0.91%) = net **+$10.00** (+0.010%) ✓

---

### Planned trades for today (Wednesday June 17, 2026)

**No new positions today. FOMC gate active — announcement TODAY June 17, 2 PM ET.**

Reasons: (1) FOMC announcement today 2 PM ET — market-open at 9:35 AM is before the announcement; dot plot hawkish risk (up to 3 members projecting hikes); Warsh may withhold his own dot (additional uncertainty); (2) LRCX ATR ~5% still disqualified; (3) NVDA above $205 but FOMC gate prevents entry before 2 PM; (4) PWR conference today may cause intraday volatility — wait for settling; (5) All 3 current positions healthy with intact theses and strong stop buffers.

**Hold LLY, V, VST.** Watch for VST ratchet if it trades above $161.48 today. Watch for V ratchet if it trades above $333.08.

**Post-FOMC (2 PM ET today onward):** Close routine to assess outcome. If neutral (rate hold + dot plot not wildly hawkish + 10yr stays below 4.75%):
1. NVDA — plan 33sh entry for Thursday June 18 open
2. LRCX — check ATR at Thursday pre-market; if ≤3%, plan 22-23sh entry (target 7% portfolio, halved if ATR borderline)
3. PWR — check post-conference ATR; if settled, plan 10-11sh entry Thursday

### Macro (pre-market June 16, 2026 ~08:03 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S&P 500 futures / SPY | **Flat, −0.04%** (pausing after June 15 +1.7% Iran-deal rally) | — | ✓ Constructive; market taking a breather |
| FOMC June 16–17 | **STARTS TODAY** — Kevin Warsh's first meeting; rate hold 97% probability | Announcement Jun 18 2 PM ET | ⚠️ HARD GATE IN EFFECT |
| Dot plot (SEP) | Shift from easing bias → neutral stance expected; Warsh may alter framing; ~70% probability of at least one year-end hike | 10yr <4.75% | ⚠️ Key risk Wednesday afternoon |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.47% est. (Jun 15) | <4.75% | ✓ Below trigger — watch post-FOMC dot plot |
| Iran/US peace deal | Still advancing; WTI ~$80/bbl; Strait of Hormuz reopening | Oil <$100 | ✓ Constructive; well below trigger |
| SPY pre-market (latest quote) | $754.87–$755.05 (+2.09% since inception $739.44) | — | ✓ Stable overnight |

**Macro posture: CAUTIOUSLY CONSTRUCTIVE, FOMC GATE DOMINANT.** The market is pausing after Monday's strong +1.7% Iran-deal rally. S&P 500 futures are essentially flat (−0.04%) as participants await Wednesday's FOMC announcement. Kevin Warsh's first meeting starts today; the dot plot is the key variable — a shift to neutral or hawkish bias (signaling no cuts and possibly hikes by year-end) could spike the 10yr above the 4.75% halt trigger. **Hard gate: NO new positions before Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET.** This gate is absolute regardless of tape conditions.

**SPY ex-dividend June 18 ($1.76/sh):** Same day as FOMC announcement. After June 18, SPY total-return anchor adjusts: $739.44 + $1.76 = $741.20 (effective anchor for post-June 18 benchmarking).

- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.457) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by = July 1 (15 days). Current $1,131.07 >> $1,064.457. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $1,131.07 − $1,064.457 = **$66.61 (5.89%)** ✓ Well protected.

**V ($323.011 pre-mkt, −0.25% today from $323.82 Jun 15 close, −0.17% from avg entry $323.57):** ✓ INTACT
- **What changed since yesterday:** No new material catalysts. Visa/OpenAI partnership confirmed; Visa trading in range $321.59–$326.44 today. Stock mildly soft with FOMC caution weighing on financials. Thesis unchanged.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings July 28, 2026 — 42 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = trailing stop fires ($293.7915) or regulatory mandate forces open access. review_by = July 28. Current $323.011 >> $293.7915. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $323.011 − $293.7915 = **$29.22 (9.04%)** ✓ Healthy.
- **Decision: HOLD. Flat performance within normal variance; no thesis break. FOMC caution on financials is temporary.**

**VST ($154.50 pre-mkt, +0.64% today from $153.52 Jun 15 close, +3.82% from avg entry $148.81):** ⭐⭐ HELIX — STRONG
- **What changed since yesterday:** Revenue forecast upgraded to $23.3B (from $18.8B) for 2026; EPS estimate raised to $9.40 (from $9.01) per analyst consensus. Helix Digital Infrastructure (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait) thesis intact. Dividend ex-date **June 22 in 6 days** (40sh × $0.229 = USD 9.16 credit). Stock up ~16% in the past week.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 6, 2026 — 51 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = WTI >$100 (NO — ~$80), FCF guidance cut (NO — upgraded), PPA/Helix cancellation (NO — Helix strengthening), breaks $130 on volume (NO — $154.50). review_by = July 7 (21 days). **THESIS INTACT AND STRENGTHENED.** ✓

### Post-FOMC candidate research (reference for Wednesday June 18+)

**Slot 1 — LRCX (Lam Research): ATR STILL ELEVATED — DEFER**
- Current price: ~$387.56 (June 15/16)
- June 15 daily move: **+5.90%** — ATR is still far above 3% threshold ❌
- Recent pattern: $366.75 (Jun 12) → $387.56 = +5.68% over 2-3 sessions — still extending, not basing
- For entry conditions to be met by Wednesday: need 2+ sessions with ATR ≤3% AND stock basing with contracting volume
- Revenue upgrades from analysts (UBS $375, Oppenheimer $400, Mizuho $380) confirm fundamental thesis
- CFO: WFE market now expected $140B (upgraded from prior estimates); advanced packaging revenue to exceed 50% growth in 2026
- **Next earnings: August 5, 2026 (50 days)** ✓
- **Re-evaluate Wednesday post-FOMC:** If FOMC neutral/in-line and LRCX settles down for 2 sessions by Wednesday, slot 1 may open Thursday.

**Slot 2 — NVDA (Nvidia): IN RE-ENTRY ZONE — post-FOMC eligible**
- Current price: ~$212.45 (June 15 close, +3.54%)
- Prior stop-out: $209.042 (June 5). Current $212.45 is above re-entry level of $205 ✓
- **Next earnings: August 25–26, 2026** (~71 days) ✓ Well outside 2-day window
- Strong fundamentals: FY2026 revenue $215.94B (+65% YoY), data center revenue up 92%
- Strong Buy from 62 analysts, avg target $298.93 (+40% upside from current price)
- Market cap ~$5T — AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact
- **Post-FOMC check Wednesday:** If FOMC neutral/in-line and NVDA closes above $205 with ATR ≤3%, eligible for Slot 2

**Slot 3 — PWR (Quanta Services): STRONG CANDIDATE — post-FOMC eligible**
- Current price: ~$707.74 (June 12 close)
- Q1 2026 adj EPS $2.68 (+50.6% YoY); revenue $7.87B (+26.4% YoY); record backlog $48.5B
- UBS PT $900, Oppenheimer PT $800 — significant upside potential
- **Institutional investor presentations TODAY (Truist Securities) and tomorrow (TD Cowen)** — potential catalyst for volatility
- Thesis: grid infrastructure + AI data-center power demand buildout
- **Need to check next earnings date post-FOMC** before entry
- Management conference this week is a catalyst watch — if stock moves strongly on conference presentations, wait for ATR to normalize before entry

---

### Cash-drag explicit decision (June 16)

Cash at 75.1% — well above the 25–40% strategy target. Explicit reasoning:
1. **FOMC gate** — Kevin Warsh's first meeting starts today; dot plot on Wednesday is the highest near-term risk event; even a neutral shift from easing to hold-for-longer could spike 10yr toward 4.75% halt trigger
2. **LRCX ATR ~5.9%** — still disqualified; extending, not basing; need 2+ quiet sessions
3. **NVDA and PWR** — both in the re-entry zone but FOMC gate takes precedence before Wednesday afternoon
4. **LLY, V, VST** — all three positions have intact/upgraded theses; VST dividend in 6 days; no urgency to add risk before rate clarity

**Post-FOMC Wednesday (June 18, 2 PM ET onwards):** Reassess with 3 full slots. Priority:
1. LRCX — only if ATR has normalized to ≤3% AND chart is basing
2. NVDA — if above $205 with calm ATR, post-FOMC clarity on rates
3. PWR — if post-conference volatility has settled and ATR is ≤3%

### Performance (pre-market June 16, 2026)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $98,901.57 (−1.10% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY pre-mkt (latest quote):** ~$754.87–$755.05 (vs anchor $739.44 = **+2.09% since inception**)
- **Estimated gap:** Bull −1.10% vs SPY +2.09% = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~3.19pp**
- Note: Gap stabilized from −3.07pp (EOD Jun 15); slight overnight improvement as positions positive. After SPY ex-div June 18 ($1.76/sh), SPY total-return anchor becomes $741.20 — will narrow reported gap by ~0.24pp.
- **Today P/L (pre-mkt unrealized):** LLY +$17.20 (+0.15%), V −$17.80 (−0.25%), VST +$39.20 (+0.64%) = net **+$38.60** (+0.039%) ✓

### Planned trades for today (Tuesday June 16, 2026)

**No new positions today. FOMC gate active — announcement Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET.**

Reasons: (1) FOMC starts TODAY — Kevin Warsh's first meeting; dot plot Wednesday critical; hawkish shift risk with 70% probability of at least one year-end hike; (2) LRCX ATR ~5.9% on June 15 — disqualified; (3) All 3 current positions (LLY, V, VST) have intact/upgraded theses and healthy stop buffers — no urgency to deploy before rate clarity.

**Hold LLY, V, VST. Watch for VST to ratchet stop if trading above HWM $155.43 at market open.**

### Macro (pre-market June 15, 2026 ~08:03 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S&P 500 futures / SPY pre-mkt | **$751.37** (+1.31% from Jun 12 close $741.67) | — | ✓ Strong broad rally |
| FOMC June 16–17 | Rate hold 98–99% probability; dot plot hawkish shift risk | No new buys before Wed Jun 18 2 PM | ⚠️ HARD GATE IN EFFECT |
| Hawkish hike risk | ~70% probability of at least one rate hike by year-end 2026 (CME FedWatch) | 10yr <4.75% | ⚠️ Dot plot key — watch 10yr post-Wed |
| Iran/US peace deal | Advancing; WTI below $100 ✓ | Oil <$100 | ✓ Constructive |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.47% (June 12 est.) | <4.75% | ✓ Below trigger — watch post-FOMC dot plot |
| Economic calendar today | Empire State Index, Industrial Production, NAHB Housing | — | Routine — not expected to be market-moving |

**Macro posture: BULLISH PRE-MARKET, BUT FOMC GATE ACTIVE.** SPY is +1.31% pre-market on continued Iran peace deal optimism and broad risk-on tone. However, FOMC June 16–17 (Kevin Warsh's first meeting as Fed Chair, with Summary of Economic Projections/dot plot) carries hawkish risk — ~70% probability of at least one rate hike by year-end. If the dot plot signals fewer cuts than market expects, 10yr could spike toward 4.75% trigger. **Hard gate: no new positions before Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET announcement.** This gate applies regardless of how constructive the tape looks Monday/Tuesday.

**SPY dividend ex-date June 18, 2026 ($1.76/sh):** This is Wednesday, same day as the FOMC announcement. After June 18, SPY total return = price return + $1.76/$739.44 = +0.238pp adjustment to SPY benchmark.

### Held positions (pre-market June 15, 2026)

**LLY ($1,140.47 pre-mkt, +0.66% today from $1,133 Jun 12 close, +4.29% from avg entry $1,093.534):** ⭐ STRONG
- **What changed since last run (Jun 12 EOD):** Weekend news: some employers (~10% of those currently covering weight-loss drugs) plan to discontinue coverage in 2027 as costs surge. Cigna dropped GLP-1 coverage for its own employees effective July. 67% of large employers still maintain coverage in 2026. This is a 2027 headwind but does NOT invalidate the July 1 Medicare GLP-1 Bridge catalyst — Medicare EXPANDS access to ~20-30M new beneficiaries, moving in the opposite direction of employer retrenchment.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings ~August 5, 2026 — 51 days away ✓ (well outside 2-day window)
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.457) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by = July 1 (16 days). Current $1,140.47 >> $1,064.457. **THESIS INTACT. No invalidation.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $1,140.47 − $1,064.457 = **$76.01 (6.67%)** ✓ Well protected.
- **Monday conviction rating: A** — original thesis intact, working, conviction still high. Medicare Bridge July 1 approaching.
- **Decision: HOLD. Employer coverage concern is a 2027 headwind, not a July 1 invalidation. Medicare Bridge expansion is the near-term driver.**

**V ($323.10 pre-mkt, +0.22% today from $322.39 Jun 12 close, −0.15% from avg entry $323.57):** ✓ INTACT
- **What changed since last run:** No new material catalysts. OpenAI partnership and stablecoin/token capabilities (announced Jun 10-12) remain the thesis drivers. Stock flat over the week. Financials sector lagging in tech-driven rallies.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings July 28, 2026 — 43 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = trailing stop fires ($293.337) or regulatory mandate forces open access. review_by = July 28. Current $323.10 >> $293.337. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $323.10 − $293.337 = **$29.76 (9.21%)** ✓ Healthy.
- **Monday conviction rating: B** — working but flat (−0.15% from entry in 5 sessions). Thesis intact but sector rotation lag continuing. No C risk.
- **Decision: HOLD. Flat performance within normal variance for a 5-session-old position. No thesis break. July 28 earnings is the next major catalyst gate.**

**VST ($152.24 pre-mkt, +2.85% today from $148.02 Jun 12 close, +2.31% from avg entry $148.81):** ⭐⭐ HELIX THESIS — STRONG
- **What changed since last run:** VST broke significantly higher over the weekend — up 2.85% to $152.24, above the HWM of $150.50 (set June 12). No specific new news found for Monday, but Helix Digital Infrastructure (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait) thesis continues to strengthen in market perception. Dividend ex-date June 22 in **7 days** — $0.229/sh × 40sh = USD 9.16 credit. Current price $152.24 vs entry $148.81 = **+2.31%**.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 6, 2026 — 52 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract (REVISED for current price):** invalidation = WTI >$100 (NO ✓ — ~$85/bbl per Iran deal), FCF guidance cut (NO ✓), PPA/Helix cancellation (NO ✓ — Helix strengthening), breaks $130 on volume (NO ✓ — $152.24). review_by = July 7 (22 days). **THESIS INTACT AND MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED.** ✓
- **Stop buffer (estimated after ratchet):** $152.24 − $137.02 (new stop after ratchet) = **~$15.22 (10.0%)** — full 10% buffer after market-open ratchet.
- **Monday conviction rating: A** — thesis upgraded (Helix), working, conviction very high. Dividend in 7 days.
- **Decision: HOLD. Let trailing stop ratchet as VST trades above $150.50. Dividend credit in 7 days. Strongest thesis upgrade in portfolio.**

---

### Thesis contract review (June 15)

- **LLY:** ✅ Intact. Stop $1,064.457. review_by July 1 (16 days). Employer coverage 2027 headwind ≠ Medicare Bridge invalidation. **CONTINUE.**
- **V:** ✅ Intact. Stop $293.337. review_by July 28. Flat but no thesis break. **CONTINUE.**
- **VST:** ✅ MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED. Invalidation criteria all clear. review_by July 7. Helix + dividend June 22. **CONTINUE.**

---

### Monday conviction-weighted holding review (3b — required every Monday)

| Symbol | Rating | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| LLY | **A** | Original thesis intact and working (+4.29% from entry); Medicare Bridge July 1 in 16 days; pipeline expansion positive; employer coverage concern is a 2027 issue, not a current invalidation |
| V | **B** | Working but flat (−0.15% from entry); thesis intact; financials sector rotation lag is expected not thesis-specific; no C flag |
| VST | **A** | Thesis materially upgraded (Helix Digital Infrastructure); +2.31% from entry; dividend June 22 in 7 days; pre-market +2.85% breakout above prior HWM |

No position rated C. No mandatory trims. Both A-rated positions holding well; V (B) needs watchful eye through July 28 earnings gate.

### LRCX ATR check (Slot 1 candidate — post-FOMC)

**LRCX snapshot (June 12 close, from Alpaca):**
- June 12: H $373.665 / L $355.28 / C $366.75 → range **$18.39 = 5.01%** ❌ (>3% threshold)
- June 11: H $364.59 / L $336.285 / C $362.58 → range **$28.31 = 7.81%** ❌
- June 10 (from log): H $347.66 / L $319.01 → range **8.91%** ❌
- **3-day average ATR: ~7.24%** — still far above 3% threshold

LRCX continues consolidating near the $360-$375 range. Entry conditions remain unmet: need 3 consecutive sessions with ATR ≤3%. If the FOMC-driven market is calm this week (rate hold + neutral dot plot), LRCX could begin to base. Re-check Thursday/Friday pre-market for ATR compliance. Next earnings August 5, 2026 (51 days away ✓).

---

### NVDA check (Slot 2 candidate — post-FOMC)

- Pre-market June 15: ~$205-$210 range (web search confirms ~$205-$210)
- Bull's prior stop-out: $209.042 (June 5)
- Next earnings: **August 26, 2026** (72 days away ✓ — well outside 2-day window)
- NVDA is basing near the $205 re-entry level flagged in the weekly review
- Post-FOMC entry eligible if: (a) stock closes above $205 with normalizing ATR, (b) FOMC is not hawkish shock (10yr stays below 4.75%), (c) Helix consortium (KKR+NVIDIA) thesis validates demand for NVDA GPU capacity
- Re-evaluate post-FOMC Wednesday afternoon

---

### Cash-drag explicit decision (June 15)

Cash at 75.1% (above strategy target 25-40%). No new positions this week before FOMC (Wednesday June 18 afternoon). Explicit reasoning:
1. **FOMC gate** — highest near-term risk event; rate hold expected but hawkish dot plot with 70% probability of year-end hike could spike 10yr above 4.75% and trigger halt-new-buys rule
2. **LRCX ATR ~7%** — still disqualified; needs 3+ sessions at ≤3%
3. **NVDA** — in the re-entry zone ($205-210) but FOMC gate takes precedence; better to wait for rate clarity before adding AI semi exposure
4. **LLY, V, VST all healthy** — existing 3 positions with intact theses and ample stop buffers; no urgency to force a 4th today

After FOMC Wednesday: reassess with full 3 slots available. Priority: (1) LRCX if ATR compliant; (2) NVDA if basing above $205; (3) PWR (Quanta Services) as new candidate.

### Performance estimate (pre-market June 15)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $98,907.25 (−1.09% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY pre-mkt June 15:** $751.37 (vs anchor $739.44 = **+1.61% since inception**)
- **Estimated gap:** Bull −1.09% vs SPY +1.61% = **Bull TRAILS SPY by ~2.70pp**
- Note: Gap widened significantly from −1.62pp (EOD June 12) because SPY rallied +1.31% pre-market. With 75% cash, Bull captures only ~25% of that move. This is expected behavior; cash cushion will protect on down days.
- **SPY dividend June 18 reminder:** After Jun 18 ex-date, add $1.76 to SPY total-return anchor ($741.75 + $1.76 = $743.51 adjusted for total-return benchmarking post-June 18)
- Today P/L (unrealized, pre-mkt): LLY +$74.70 (+0.66%), V +$15.62 (+0.22%), VST +$168.92 (+2.85%) = net **+$259.24** (+0.263%) ✓

### Planned trades for today (Monday June 15, 2026)

**No new positions today. FOMC gate active through Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET.**

Reasons: (1) FOMC June 16–17 (announcement June 18 2 PM ET) — Kevin Warsh's first meeting with dot plot; hawkish bias risk with 70% probability of at least one year-end hike; (2) LRCX ATR ~7.24% — disqualified per volatility rule; (3) NVDA re-entry zone but FOMC gate prevents entry before Wednesday; (4) All 3 current positions (LLY, V, VST) have intact/upgraded theses and healthy stop buffers — no urgency.

**Hold LLY, V, VST. Let VST trailing stop ratchet above HWM $150.50 at market open.**

**VST watch:** When market opens, VST trading above $150.50 triggers automatic stop ratchet to ~$137.02. Market-open routine to confirm.

**Post-FOMC Wednesday June 18 (2 PM ET onwards):** Reassess with full 3 slots. Priority order:
1. LRCX — only if ATR has normalized to ≤3% for 3+ sessions by Wednesday
2. NVDA — re-entry if basing above $205 with calm ATR; thesis: AI accelerator monopoly + Helix consortium
3. PWR (Quanta Services) — new candidate; Q1 EPS +31.4% beat, revenue +26.3% beat; AI data-center grid infrastructure

## 2026-06-12 — Weekly Review research (~16:30 ET)

_Dated research findings for the weekly review of the week of June 8–12, 2026._

### Macro — week of June 8–12 review

- **S&P 500 weekly performance:** SPY +0.58% for the week ($737.45 → $741.75 actual close). Market driven by Iran/US peace deal progress — WTI crude fell to ~$85/bbl. Roller-coaster week: Monday oil spike ($93.67 on Iran/Israel strikes), then steady recovery. June 10 worst day (CPI 4.2% YoY, Iran strikes, VIX +12%, SPY −1.67%). June 11–12 recovered on peace-deal optimism. Source: Schwab weekly update 2026-06-12, Alpaca bars.
- **FOMC June 16–17 (next week):** 89% probability of rate hold. Possible bias shift from easing to neutral/tightening — first explicit hawkish pivot signal. Announcement Wednesday June 18, 2 PM ET. 10yr yield watch: any spike above 4.75% post-FOMC is the halt-new-buys trigger. New Fed Chair Kevin Warsh known to be hawkish. Source: IndexBox FOMC preview 2026-06-12.
- **SpaceX SPCX IPO June 12:** Debuted $135 → closed $161 (+19%). Largest IPO in history ($1.77T). Tech capital rotation explains Nasdaq 100 −0.5% vs S&P +0.34% on June 12. Source: market context, today's routines.
- **Iran/US peace deal:** Draft agreement largely complete. WTI $85/bbl — below $100 trigger ✓. Strait of Hormuz to reopen within 30 days. Constructive for market; slight VST nuclear relative economics headwind as natural gas improves when oil falls (but nuclear 24/7 reliability advantage intact). Source: Schwab update, today's pre-market.
- **10yr yield:** ~4.47% — below 4.75% watch trigger ✓. Constructive despite hot CPI.

### Held positions — week review (2026-06-12)

- **LLY:** +4.50% week per VantagePoint AI. ATH $1,182.73 hit June 8. EOD $1,138.355 (+4.10% from entry). Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 in 19 days. Pipeline expansion: Phase 2 trials initiated for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis. GLP-1 market leadership intact. THESIS: STRONGEST. Sources: VantagePoint AI June 2026, today's research.
- **VST:** Fell ~4.82% week-over-week from prior highs but recovered strongly by June 12. Helix Digital Infrastructure launch June 11 (KKR+NVIDIA+Kuwait, $10B+, VST preferred power partner) — major thesis upgrade. Ex-dividend June 22 ($0.23/sh, $9.20 credit for 40sh). Analyst PT $230.50 median; 19 Buy. EOD $147.98 (−0.56% from entry). Source: Finviz, stockinvest.us, today's routine data.
- **V:** Flat week. EOD $322.34 (−0.42% from entry $323.57). Trading range $319–$325 all week. OpenAI partnership confirms AI-commerce thesis. 52-week low $293.89 (Apr 1). Source: MarketBeat, Yahoo Finance.

### Watchlist research (2026-06-12)

- **LRCX:** Consolidating. June 9 close $327.16 (vs June 3 peak $343.71 = −4.8% from peak). ATR ~5.85% at June 9 — still above 3% threshold ❌. Cantor Fitzgerald PT raised to $425 (from $320) June 10. Barclays PT raised to $335. MACD bullish; above 20-day SMA. Re-evaluate June 16+: need 3+ sessions with <3% daily range. Source: historicaloptiondata.com June 9, 2026, Cantor/Barclays upgrades.
- **NVDA:** Senate Banking hearing passed without CEO Huang testimony — regulatory overhang reduced. Helix consortium (KKR+NVIDIA+VST) is a positive real-world AI contract signal. Bull stopped out at $209.04 June 5. Re-entry possible post-FOMC if stock bases above $205 with normalized ATR.
- **PWR (Quanta Services) — NEW CANDIDATE:** Q1 2026 EPS +31.4% beat, revenue +26.3% beat. Infrastructure play on AI data-center grid buildout. Not on watchlist yet — add to research queue for June 16+ evaluation. Fits "real-economy AI beneficiary" theme from strategy thesis. Source: top performers search June 2026.

## 2026-06-12 — Pre-market research (~08:04 ET)

### Macro (pre-market June 12, 2026 ~08:04 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S&P 500 futures | **+0.41%** (ESM26) | — | ✓ Extending yesterday's +1.75% — Iran peace deal imminent |
| S&P 500 June 11 close | ~7,394 (SPY ~$737-740) | — | ✓ +1.75% yesterday — broad risk-on |
| Iran/US peace deal | Trump signals imminent signing — Polymarket 83% chance higher open | Oil <$100 | ✓ Oil FALLING — massive tailwind |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.47% (est., post-Iran rally) | <4.75% | ✓ Below trigger |
| WTI crude | Falling on Iran peace signal (<$90 est.) | <$100 | ✓ Well below trigger — NEW BUYS ELIGIBLE |
| SpaceX Nasdaq IPO | USD 75B raise / USD 1.77T valuation (largest IPO in history) | — | ⚡ Broad risk appetite signal |

**Macro posture: CONSTRUCTIVELY BULLISH.** Iran peace deal signal drove S&P +1.75% Thursday and futures are extending +0.41% Friday. Oil is falling rapidly as the geopolitical risk premium unwinds — this is a direct VST thesis tailwind (cheap natural gas prices make nuclear power more competitive on margin; and oil/war de-escalation removes the "risk premium" that was crushing VST). The SpaceX IPO captures discretionary capital but broad risk appetite is healthy. Both market conditions and sector-specific factors are favorable for our three holdings. No new positions today (Friday weekend risk + slot 3 intentionally expired + LRCX ATR ~10%).

### Held positions (pre-market June 12, 2026)

**LLY ($1,165.35 pre-mkt, +0.38% today from $1,160.95 June 11 close, +6.57% from avg entry $1,093.534):** ⭐ EXCEPTIONAL
- **What changed since yesterday:** New pipeline expansion announced — Phase 2 trial initiated for Chronic Low Back Pain Relief; new Osteoarthritis trial added. Both expand Lilly's addressable market beyond obesity/diabetes into chronic pain. This is positive — pipeline diversification reduces single-catalyst dependency. June 11 all-time portfolio HWM was set at $1,182.73 (June 8); today's pre-mkt $1,165.35 is $17.38 below HWM. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 in 19 days — key thesis catalyst approaching.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 5, 2026 — 54 days away ✓ (well outside 2-day window)
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.46) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by = July 1. Current $1,165.35 >> $1,064.46. **THESIS INTACT. No invalidation triggered.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $1,165.35 - $1,064.457 = **$100.89 (8.66%)** ✓ Excellent.
- **Decision: HOLD. Thesis strengthening (pipeline expansion). Medicare Bridge catalyst 19 days away.**

**V ($320.55 pre-mkt, +0.47% today from $319.05 June 11 close, -0.93% from avg entry $323.57):** ✓ INTACT
- **What changed since yesterday:** Visa announced new AI, stablecoin, and token capabilities at its Payments Forum 2026 — directly confirms the AI-driven digital commerce thesis. The OpenAI partnership (agentic transactions) plus new stablecoin/token layer reinforces Visa's payments infrastructure moat. However, V dropped -1.24% on June 11 despite SPY +1.75% — persistent underperformance in risk-on rallies suggests financial sector rotation lag vs tech/energy. Not thesis-specific.
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings July 28, 2026 — 46 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = trailing stop fires ($292.96) or regulatory mandate forces open access. review_by = July 28. Current $320.55 >> $292.96. **THESIS INTACT.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $320.55 - $292.959 = **$27.59 (8.60%)** ✓ Healthy.
- **Note on underperformance:** V has lagged the market on 3 of 4 positive trading days since entry. This is not thesis-breaking — financials rotate slower than tech/energy in AI-driven rallies. But it is worth noting. Will track whether V begins to participate as Iran-deal risk-off unwinds and payment volumes re-accelerate. Current -0.93% from entry is within normal variance for a 3-day-old position. **HOLD.**

**VST ($148.47 pre-mkt, +1.43% today from $146.38 June 11 close, -0.23% from avg entry $148.81):** ⭐⭐ THESIS MAJOR UPGRADE
- **What changed since yesterday:** MAJOR CATALYST — KKR, Kuwait Investment Authority, NVIDIA, and Vistra jointly launched **Helix Digital Infrastructure** (June 11, 2026). Helix is a new $10B+ AI infrastructure platform. Key details:
  - **Vistra is the PREFERRED POWER PARTNER** for Helix — not just a PPA counterparty but embedded as the preferred provider for the entire KKR/NVIDIA AI infrastructure ecosystem
  - $10B+ in total long-duration capital commitments secured at launch
  - Led by Adam Selipsky (former AWS CEO) — credibility signal
  - Kuwait Investment Authority as co-investor — sovereign wealth validation
  - Helix serves as single coordination point for hyperscalers' data centers, power, connectivity needs
  - NVIDIA as cornerstone strategic partner — means NVIDIA is directing GPU customers to Helix-powered infrastructure where VST provides the power
  - This transcends the existing Meta/Amazon PPAs: VST is now EMBEDDED in a NEW AI infrastructure platform backed by the most important names in AI capital (KKR) and compute (NVIDIA)
- **Earnings window:** Next earnings August 6, 2026 — 55 days away ✓
- **Thesis contract (REVISED):** invalidation = WTI >$100 (FALLING — further away ✓), FCF guidance cut, PPA/Helix partnership cancellation, or breaks below $130 on volume. review_by = July 7. Current $148.47. WTI well below $100. Helix launch REINFORCES and EXPANDS thesis. **THESIS INTACT AND MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED.** ✓
- **Stop buffer:** $148.47 - $135.270 = **$13.20 (8.89%)** ✓ Strong recovery.
- **-7% cut threshold:** $138.39 — VST at $148.47 is **$10.08 above it** ✓ CLEAR
- **Dividend ex-date:** June 22 (10 days) — USD 9.20 for 40 shares (confirmed $0.23/sh × 40sh)
- **Decision: HOLD. Helix launch is a material thesis upgrade. VST is now more than a "nuclear PPA story" — it is the preferred power infrastructure backbone for KKR+NVIDIA's AI infrastructure platform. Do not let the trailing stop close this prematurely. Current stop at $135.27 is $13.20 below market.**

### Thesis contract review (June 12)

- **LLY:** ✅ Intact. Stop $1,064.46. review_by July 1. Distance to stop: $100.89. No invalidation triggered. **CONTINUE.**
- **V:** ✅ Intact. Stop $292.96. review_by July 28. Distance to stop: $27.59. No invalidation triggered. **CONTINUE.**
- **VST:** ✅ MATERIALLY STRENGTHENED. Invalidation criteria: WTI >$100 (NO ✓ — falling), FCF cut (NO ✓), PPA/Helix cancellation (NO ✓ — Helix JUST LAUNCHED), breaks $130 on volume (NO ✓ — $148.47). review_by July 7. **CONTINUE. Thesis upgrade.**

### New position research — Slot 3 (Week of June 8, expires today)

**LRCX (Lam Research): DEFER — ATR still elevated; stock extended**

**ATR check (3-day, June 9-11 — from Alpaca bars):**
- June 11: H $364.59 / L $336.285 / C $362.58 → range **$28.305 = 7.81%** ❌ (WAY above 3%)
- June 10: H $347.66 / L $319.01 / C $321.74 → range **$28.65 = 8.91%** ❌
- June 9: H $349.00 / L $306.03 / C $327.195 → range **$42.97 = 13.13%** ❌
- **3-day average ATR: ~9.95%** — still far above the 3% ATR threshold

**Extension check:** LRCX +12.7% on June 11 alone ($321.74 → $362.58). In 6 trading days since June 5 ($303.26), LRCX is up +19.5%. This is a parabolic extension, not a controlled basing pattern. The stock needs to consolidate for several sessions before a clean risk-defined entry is possible.

**Additional factors against Friday entry:**
- Weekend risk: opening a position on Friday that's +19.5% in 6 days with ~10% ATR creates substantial gap risk over the weekend
- Slot 3 was explicitly deferred all week — the discipline of that decision should hold

**Decision: SLOT 3 EXPIRES UNUSED. Deliberate and correct.**

**LRCX re-evaluation week of June 16:**
Conditions for re-entry:
1. ATR normalizes to ≤3% (needs 3+ consecutive quiet sessions with ranges <3%)
2. Stock bases (2-3 sessions with tight closes, contracting volume, no new lows)
3. Not extended >10% above 50-day SMA (need to verify — but at $362.58 after +19.5% 6-day run, extension is likely significant)
4. No earnings in next 2 trading days (confirmed: August 5, 2026 ✓)

---

### Cash-drag explicit decision (June 12 — Friday)

Cash at 75.1% remains above strategy target (25-40%). Slot 3 of June 8 week expires unused today — fourth consecutive deferral since Monday. Explicit reasoning:
1. **LRCX ATR ~10%** — structurally inadvisable; even halved position creates unacceptable stop exposure
2. **LRCX extended** — +19.5% in 6 sessions, not a controlled base entry
3. **Friday weekend risk** — new position on a Friday after a parabolic run carries gap risk
4. **VST Helix upgrade** — the preferred power provider thesis is now materially stronger; the existing portfolio (LLY + V + VST) has improved quality while maintaining low drawdown risk

Next week (June 16) brings 3 fresh slots. No urgency to force any position today.

---

### Performance estimate (pre-market June 12)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $98,949.03 (−1.05% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY June 11 close (est.):** ~$737.62
- **SPY pre-mkt estimate (futures +0.41%):** ~$740.65 → +0.16% since inception ($739.44)
- **Estimated gap:** Bull −1.05% vs SPY +0.16% = **~−1.21%** (gap widening slightly as SPY continues recovering from June 10 selloff; 75% cash limits upside capture)
- **Today P/L (unrealized, pre-mkt):** LLY +$44 (0.38%), V +$33 (0.47%), VST +$83.60 (1.43%) = net +$160.60 ✓

---

### Planned trades for today (Friday June 12, 2026)

**No new positions today.**

Reasons: (1) LRCX ATR ~9.95% — disqualified per volatility rule; stock extended +19.5% in 6 sessions; (2) Friday weekend risk — no new position opens with parabolic, high-ATR names before weekend; (3) Slot 3 of June 8 week intentionally expired unused — disciplined decision upheld all week; (4) Existing 3 positions (LLY, V, VST) all have intact/strengthened theses and healthy stop buffers. No urgency to force a fourth.

**Hold LLY, V, VST.** Let trailing stops work.

**Next week (June 16+):** 3 fresh slots. Priority research:
1. **LRCX** — re-evaluate if ATR normalizes and chart bases after 3+ quiet sessions
2. **NVDA** — Senate hearing passed (Huang didn't testify; hearing proceeded without CEO testimony). Re-evaluate post-hearing regulatory clarity. Prior stop-out was at $209.042. Would be a fresh entry.
3. **One new name** — COST (consumer defensive quality compounder), or MSFT (Azure AI thesis intact, may have re-based since stop-out at $419).

**VST watch:** Dividend ex-date June 22 in 10 days. Helix launch is thesis-upgradeable — monitor if market reprices VST significantly higher into next week. If VST breaks above HWM $150.30, stop auto-ratchets higher — protecting expanded gains.

## 2026-06-11 — Pre-market research (~08:05 ET)

**Today is Thursday June 11. Week of June 8: 2/3 new positions used (VST June 9, V June 10). 1 slot remaining.**

### Macro (pre-market June 11, 2026 ~08:05 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| S&P 500 futures | **+0.78%** | — | ✓ Rebounding after Wed -1.62% selloff |
| SPY June 10 close (Alpaca) | **$724.73** (prev $737.07 = Jun 9 close) | — | SPY -1.67% Wednesday — bigger than recorded |
| May PPI | **Due 8:30 AM ET today** | 10yr <4.75% | ⏳ KEY RISK — if hot, rate spike possible |
| Iran/US conflict | Ongoing military strikes; market watching oil/inflation | Oil <$100 | ⚠️ Monitor |
| NVDA Senate hearing | 10 AM ET today — Huang declined; non-NVDA witnesses testify | — | ⚠️ AI semi risk during market hours |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.54% (June 10 estimate) | <4.75% | ✓ Below trigger |
| WTI crude | ~$88-90 area (easing) | <$100 | ✓ Below trigger |

**Macro posture: CAUTIOUSLY CONSTRUCTIVE.** Futures +0.78% — broad rebound from Wednesday's -1.62% SPY selloff (driven by Trump Iran military threat escalation). However, two key risk events unfold TODAY during the session: (1) May PPI at 8:30 AM — if hot, 10yr could spike above 4.75% and halt any new buys; (2) NVDA Senate Banking hearing at 10 AM — Huang declined to testify but panel proceeds; AI semi sector sentiment may shift during the session. No new positions until both events have cleared. The recovery in futures is constructive but not yet confirmed.

### Held positions (pre-market June 11, 2026)

**LLY ($1,136.26 pre-mkt, -0.68% today from $1,143.94 June 10 close, +3.90% from avg entry $1,093.534):** ⭐ STRONG
- **What changed since yesterday:** No material negative events. Foundayo safety: FDA requested post-approval safety studies; 34 adverse event reports since April 9 launch including one liver failure case (April 30, 56-year-old male) — Lilly's Global Patient Safety team assessed the event as **unlikely to be connected to Foundayo**. This is manageable; the oral GLP-1 with a shorter safety track record than tirzepatide warranted FDA caution, but Lilly investigated and cleared the case. Three pipeline acquisitions announced (~USD 4B total): Curevo, LimmaTech Biologics, and other entities — expanding into vaccines/infectious disease. POSITIVE diversification. Jefferies PT $1,350 confirmed ✓. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 now 20 days away.
- **Stop buffer:** $1,136.26 - $1,064.457 = **$71.80 (6.32%)** ✓ Well protected.
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = stop fires ($1,064.46) or Medicare Bridge reversed. review_by = July 1. Current $1,136.26 >> $1,064.46. **THESIS INTACT. HOLD.**
- **Decision: HOLD. Foundayo safety concern is immaterial (cleared by Lilly). Thesis strengthening.**

**V ($322.94 pre-mkt, -0.66% today from $325.05 June 10 close, -0.19% from avg entry $323.57):** ✓ FLAT/INTACT
- **What changed since yesterday:** Visa-OpenAI partnership announced — Visa to be integrated into OpenAI's platform, enabling online retailers to accept AI agent-driven transactions. POSITIVE — directly confirms the AI-driven commerce secular growth thesis. $38 billion swipe fee settlement resolved — removes long-standing regulatory overhang. POSITIVE. Pre-market weakness (-0.66%) is market-correlated, not Visa-specific.
- **Stop buffer:** $322.94 - $292.959 = **$29.98 (9.27%)** ✓ Healthy.
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = trailing stop fires ($292.96) or Visa loses major network exclusivity, or regulatory mandate forces open access. review_by = July 28. Current $322.94 >> $292.96. **THESIS INTACT. HOLD.**
- **Decision: HOLD. OpenAI integration is direct thesis confirmation. No action.**

**VST ($141.40 pre-mkt per positions API, +2.06% today from $138.54 June 10 close, -4.98% from avg entry $148.81):** ✓ RECOVERING ⬆️
- **What changed since yesterday:** SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY. VST closed June 10 at $138.51-$138.54 (only $0.12-$0.15 above the -7% cut threshold of $138.39 — even more critical than the $138.91 recorded at 15:52 ET). In pre-market June 11, VST is +2.06% to $141.40 — the recovery is driven by broad market rebound (+0.78% futures). No VST-specific news beyond the pre-market strength. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan maintained Overweight and raised price targets. Dividend ex-date June 22 in 11 days (USD 9.16 credit for 40sh). Nuclear PPAs with Meta + AWS unchanged.
- **Stop buffer:** $141.40 - $135.270 = **$6.13 (4.33%)** ✓ Improved from Wednesday's critical 2.62%.
- **-7% cut threshold:** $138.39 — VST is $3.01 above it (2.18% cushion). Much improved.
- **Thesis contract:** invalidation = WTI >$100, FCF guidance cut, hyperscaler PPA cancellation, or breaks below $130 on volume. review_by = July 7. Current $141.40 >> $130 invalidation. WTI ~$88 ✓. PPAs unchanged ✓. **THESIS INTACT. HOLD.**
- **Decision: HOLD. Pre-market recovery is encouraging. Stop at $135.27 provides defined floor. Midday: verify -7% rule compliance (VST must be > $138.39 at 12:30 ET). Do NOT pre-empt the stop unless -7% rule is breached.**

### New position research — Slot 3

**LRCX (Lam Research): DEFER — ATR disqualifies entry this week**

- **Price:** $321.74 (June 10 close)
- **Next earnings:** August 5, 2026 — well outside 2-day window ✓
- **Q3 2026:** EPS $1.46 (+40% YoY), revenue $5.84B (+24% YoY), both beat estimates ✓
- **June quarter guidance:** $6.6B ±$400M revenue (record), EPS $1.65 ±$0.15 ✓
- **UBS raised PT:** $375 from $310 on June 9 ✓
- **Dividend ex-date:** June 17, 2026 (6 days away) — NOT an earnings event, dividend only ✓

**ATR check (2-day sample, June 9-10):**
- June 10: H $347.66 / L $319.01 / C $321.74 → range **8.91%** ❌ (>3% threshold)
- June 9: H $349.00 / L $306.03 / C $327.195 → range **13.13%** ❌ (>3% threshold)
- 2-day average: **~11.0%** — WAY above 3% ATR threshold

Per the volatility check rule, ATR > 3% requires halving position size. But at 11% ATR, even a halved position means a 10% trailing stop provides only ~1 average day of cushion. This is not a manageable risk profile — LRCX is too volatile to enter this week.

**NVDA hearing factor:** The Senate Banking hearing begins 10 AM ET today. Huang declined to testify, reducing the risk of damaging CEO testimony. However, the hearing unfolds during the trading session, and AI semi sentiment may shift intraday. LRCX (semi equipment) is directly correlated.

**Decision: DEFER LRCX to next week (June 16+) when:**
1. ATR normalizes to ≤3% (requires 3+ quiet sessions)
2. NVDA hearing outcome is known and AI semi sentiment has stabilized
3. LRCX shows clear basing (≥2 consecutive days with tight closes and low volume)

**Week of June 8 Slot 3: UNUSED.** This is a deliberate, disciplined decision — not a passive default.

---

### Cash-drag explicit decision (June 11)

Cash at 75.5% is above the strategy target band (25-40% in build phase with 6-8 positions). The week's 1 remaining slot (Slot 3) will expire unused. This is correct for three reasons:
1. **LRCX ATR ~11%** makes entry this week structurally inadvisable even with halved sizing
2. **NVDA hearing today 10 AM** introduces mid-session AI semi risk that would directly affect LRCX
3. **May PPI 8:30 AM** creates early-session rate risk — if hot, 10yr spikes above 4.75% and no new buys today

Next week (June 16) brings 3 fresh slots. LRCX entry with a stabilized ATR, post-hearing clarity, and full week of slots is a better setup than forcing entry this week under elevated volatility.

---

### Performance estimate (pre-market June 11)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $98,438.13 (−1.56% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY June 10 close (Alpaca):** $724.73 → −1.99% since inception $739.44
- **June 10 close gap:** Bull −1.69% ($98,315.05) vs SPY −1.99% ($724.73) = **Bull leads SPY by +0.30%** ✓
- **Pre-mkt SPY estimate:** $724.73 × 1.0078 ≈ $730.39 → −1.22% since inception
- **Pre-mkt estimated gap:** Bull −1.56% vs SPY −1.22% = −0.34% (Bull slightly trails as SPY recovers)
- Today P/L pre-mkt: LLY −$77.80 (−0.68%), V −$18.04 (−0.66%), VST +$114.40 (+2.06%) = net +$18.56 (+0.02%)

---

### Planned trades for today (Thursday June 11, 2026)

**No new positions today.**

Reasons: (1) LRCX ATR ~11% — disqualified per volatility rule even with halved sizing; (2) NVDA Senate hearing at 10 AM creates mid-session AI semi volatility; (3) May PPI at 8:30 AM creates early-session rate risk. Slot 3 intentionally expires unused — a disciplined cash decision, not a passive default.

**Hold LLY, V, VST.** Let all trailing stops work.

**VST watch at midday:** VST must remain > $138.39 at 12:30 PM check. Pre-market $141.40 shows cushion, but the session outcome matters.

## 2026-06-10 — Pre-market research (~08:08 ET)

**Today is Wednesday June 10. Week of June 8: 1/3 new positions used (VST June 9). 2 slots remaining.**

### Macro (pre-market June 10, 2026 ~08:08 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| WTI crude oil | **~$88/bbl** (−3% as Iran/Israel halt attacks) | <$100 halt-new-buys | ✓ FALLING — new buys eligible |
| S&P 500 futures | **−0.47%** | — | ⚠️ Weak — Polymarket 22% chance positive open |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.54% (June 9 close; pre-mkt unchanged) | <4.75% watch | ✓ Below trigger — but CPI risk |
| **May CPI — due 8:30 AM ET TODAY** | Expected 4.2% YoY (core 2.9%) | 4.75% 10yr trigger | ⏳ KEY EVENT — first above 4% since May 2023 |
| Iran/US conflict | US and Iran exchanged military strikes overnight; Israel-Iran agreed to halt attacks; WTI falling | Oil <$100 | ⚠️ Volatile but de-escalating |
| Tech sector | AI names extending losses — overheating AI concern + inflation | — | ⚠️ Headwind |

**Macro posture: CAUTIOUS.** The dominant risk is the May CPI report at 8:30 AM ET. Expected headline 4.2% YoY — the highest reading since May 2023. If CPI prints hot or the 10yr yield spikes above 4.75% post-release, NO new buys today. The US-Iran exchange of strikes was alarming overnight, but WTI fell ~3% to ~$88 after a halt agreement, pulling the $100 oil trigger further away. Net oil direction: constructive for new buys. But the CPI gating condition is paramount — the market-open routine MUST check the actual CPI print and 10yr yield at 9:35 AM before executing any buy.

**LLY ($1,137.01 pre-mkt, −0.67% today, +3.98% from avg entry $1,093.534):** ⭐ STRONG
- Jefferies raised price target to $1,350 (from $1,330) — analyst conviction increasing.
- LLY down modestly pre-market; no negative thesis events. Retatrutide Phase 3 data, all PBMs covering, Medicare Bridge July 1 (21 days) all intact.

- Dividend ex-date: June 15 ($0.525 × 15sh = $7.875 credit) — 5 days away. If META stops out before June 15, we miss this dividend.
- Next earnings: July 29, 2026.
- No META-specific negative catalyst today; weakness is macro-driven (market -0.47%, CPI risk, AI sector headwind).
- AI ad thesis (Q1 revenue +33% YoY, enterprise AI agents, BofA Buy $856 PT) remains intact.
- **With market futures −0.47% and hot CPI risk at 8:30 AM, META's trailing stop may fire at market open. This is the stop doing its job. DO NOT manually intervene. Let the stop manage the exit.**

### Thesis contract review (June 10)

At $580 pre-market, META is at the invalidation boundary. **Decision: HOLD and let stop manage. If stop fires, the position exits automatically — that is correct process.** The AI ad thesis is not broken; the price action is responding to macro shock. Do NOT manually force an exit or extension.
- **VST:** invalidation = WTI >$100, FCF guidance cut, hyperscaler PPA cancellation, or breaks below $130 on volume. review_by = July 7, 2026 (set today — 4 weeks from June 9 entry). Thesis intact on all invalidation criteria. WTI $88 ✓. No guidance changes ✓. PPAs unchanged ✓. **CONTINUE.** ✓

### New position research

**Slot 2 — V (Visa): CONDITIONAL BUY — concern RESOLVED**

**BLOCKER RESOLVED:** CFO Chris Suh's May 12 sale of 10,639 shares at $324.88 was executed under a **pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan** (confirmed via SEC filing). This was NOT a discretionary open-market sale. The concern that has blocked V for two weeks is now cleared.

**Current price:** $325.055 (June 9 close). V is trading ABOVE the CFO's $324.88 sale price — constructive.

**Thesis:**
Visa is the world's largest payments network — an asset-light moat that processes every dollar of digital commerce, earns a fee on each transaction, and benefits structurally from cash-to-card conversion and the secular growth in AI-driven digital commerce. Q2 FY26: net revenue $11.2B (+17% YoY), non-GAAP EPS $3.31 (beat). $20B buyback just authorized — signals management confidence. The company faces no existential threat from crypto or CBDCs in the near term. Adds Financials sector diversification to a portfolio currently heavy in Healthcare/Tech/Energy.

**Entry signal check (need ≥3 of 5):**
1. ✓ Earnings momentum: Q2 FY26 +17% revenue YoY, EPS beat by 2.8%; strong track record
2. ✓ Clear catalyst: $20B buyback authorized; AI commerce growth driving transaction volumes; Q3 earnings July 28
3. ✓ Reasonable valuation: Visa's durable moat and minimal capex justify premium; reasonable vs. history given rate environment
4. ✓ Technical: V closed $325 on June 9, up from $319.72 June 8 — recovering after CFO-overhang suppressed price. Now trading at/above CFO sale price. Momentum is constructive.
5. ✓ Macro tailwind: Strong US consumer; digital payments penetration growing; AI-driven commerce volumes accelerating. Financials sector not correlated with AI semi volatility.

**Result: 5 of 5 criteria met → STRONG BUY signal (conditional on CPI).**

**Earnings window:** V Q3 FY26 earnings July 28, 2026 — **48 days away**. Well outside 2-day earnings window. ✓

**ATR check:** V June 9 range: $325.45−$317.13 = $8.32 (2.56%). June 8 range: $4.88 (1.53%). Estimated 20-day ATR ~2.0% — well below 3% threshold. No position halving needed. ✓

**Sizing:**
- 22 shares × $325 = **$7,150 = 7.3% of portfolio** (starter conviction)
- Cash after fill: $72,753 − $7,150 = $65,603 = 66.5% >> 5% minimum ✓
- Daily deployment: $7,150 = 7.3% ≤ 25% cap ✓
- Single position cap: 7.3% ≤ 20% cap ✓
- Sector: Financials — adds diversification ✓
- New positions this week: 2/3 (VST June 9, V June 10) ✓
- Risk budget: 22sh × $325 × 10% stop = $715 loss = 0.73% of equity ✓ (≤1.2%)

**Stop:** 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.

**CPI condition (CRITICAL):** The market-open routine MUST verify at 9:35 AM:
(1) Actual May CPI headline ≤ 4.2% YoY AND 10yr Treasury below 4.75% at market open time.
(2) V opens in the $310–$340 range (not gapping beyond 5% from prior close).
If CPI comes in hot (> 4.2%) or 10yr spikes above 4.75% → DEFER V to Thursday or next week.

---

**Slot 3 — LRCX: DEFER**
- LRCX closed $327 on June 9 but had a massive intraday range: high $349, low $306 (13.1% single-day range). Still too volatile.
- NVDA Senate Banking Committee hearing June 11 (tomorrow) — CEO Huang declined to testify; hearing proceeds. This is primarily an AI semi regulatory catalyst. Semi equipment sector (LRCX) will react to hearing outcome.
- Pre-market LRCX: ~$309 — still below recent closes. Not basing cleanly.
- **Decision: DEFER. Re-evaluate Thursday or next week once post-hearing AI semi sentiment clarifies.** Slot 3 remains open.

### Performance estimate (pre-market June 10)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $98,568.84 (−1.43% since inception $100,000)
- **SPY estimate:** ~$729.6 (futures −0.47% from $733.06 June 9 close) → −1.33% since inception
- **Estimated gap:** ~−0.10% (essentially at par — SPY weakness pre-market bringing it toward Bull)
- Today P/L (unrealized, pre-mkt): LLY −$76.70, META −$68.85, VST −$103.25 = **−$248.80** (−0.25%)

---

### Planned trades for today (Wednesday June 10, 2026)

**Primary: BUY V (Visa) 22 shares — CONDITIONAL on CPI and 10yr yield**

**Conditions (market-open routine must verify before executing):**
- Actual May CPI ≤ 4.2% YoY headline AND 10yr Treasury yield < 4.75% at 9:35 AM
- V opens in the $310–$340 range
- Market not in freefall (SPY not down > 1.5% at open)

**Hold LLY, META (stop active), VST.**

**CPI hot-case (10yr > 4.75% at open):** No trades today. Defer V to Thursday/Friday once rate shock is absorbed.

**META watch:** If META opens at or below $578.142, the trailing stop fires automatically — no manual intervention needed. If META opens at $578–$582, it is on life support; midday -7% rule at $577.19 is the next guardrail.

- **META dividend ex-date June 15** ($7.875 credit — hold if possible)
- **VST dividend ex-date June 22** ($9.16 credit)

## 2026-06-09 — Pre-market research (~08:07 ET)

**Today is Tuesday June 9. Week of June 8: 0/3 new positions used. 3 fresh slots.**

### Macro (pre-market June 9, 2026 ~08:07 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| WTI crude oil | **$90.20** (−1.2% today) | <$100 halt-new-buys | ✓ FALLING — Iran/Israel tensions easing |
| Brent crude | ~$93.30 | — | ✓ Pulling back from recent highs |
| S&P 500 futures | **+0.71%** | — | ✓ Strong rebound; chip stocks leading |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.55–4.57% (est; post-NFP level) | <4.75% watch | ✓ Below trigger |
| Iran/Israel | Pause in attacks overnight — tensions easing | Oil <$100 | ✓ Improving; WTI falling |
| NVDA CEO testimony | Jensen Huang **DECLINED** Senate testimony June 11 | — | ✓ Reduces CEO testimony tail risk |
| Economic data today | Wholesale inventories, existing home sales, NFIB small biz sentiment | — | Watch — not expected to be market-moving |

**Macro posture: CONSTRUCTIVE.** Iran/Israel easing is the dominant overnight development. WTI fell −1.2% to $90.20, pulling the $100 halt trigger $9.80 further away — and moving in the right direction. S&P futures +0.71% led by chip stock rebound. NVDA CEO declining Senate testimony removes the tail risk of CEO-testifies-and-makes-damaging-admissions scenario; the hearing proceeds without NVDA's cooperation. New positions are **ELIGIBLE** today (WTI <$100 ✓, 10yr <4.75% ✓, oil direction improving ✓).

### New position research

**Slot 1 — VST (Vistra Energy): CONDITIONAL BUY TODAY**

**Current price:** $146.885 (June 8 close). Last week's range: $147.52–$154.29 (Jun 5).

**Thesis:**
VST is a nuclear power operator that has locked in **20-year PPAs with Meta Platforms and Amazon** for baseload AI data-center electricity supply. As AI hyperscalers demand 24/7 clean baseload power (not intermittent solar/wind), nuclear is the only reliable answer at scale. VST is uniquely positioned: it owns the Perry nuclear plant (restarting), has existing nuclear fleet capacity, and has secured long-term contracted revenue streams with two of the world's largest AI buildout spenders.

**Entry signal check (need ≥3 of 5):**
1. ✓ Earnings momentum: Q1 2026 EPS +10.52% beat, revenue +8%, adj EBITDA +20% YoY. Stock jumped +14% on Q1 results.
2. ✓ Clear catalyst: 20-yr PPAs with Meta + AWS locked; Perry nuclear plant restart; AI power demand secular — hyperscaler electricity consumption doubling every 2 years.
3. ✓ Valuation: $220-225 analyst consensus target vs $146.89 current = **50%+ upside**. FCF yield highly attractive. 19 analysts Strong Buy.
4. ✗ Technical: VST at $146.885 is BELOW its 50-day SMA (~$154). ⚠️ Stock down 7% YTD.
   _Note: Below 50-day SMA is a genuine technical caution flag. However, the Q1 +14% jump and subsequent pullback to $146 may represent a "buy the dip after Q1 pop" opportunity._
5. ✓ Macro: WTI falling (eases near-term energy market uncertainty); Iran/Israel easing reduces commodity shock risk; AI data-center buildout continuing at accelerating pace. VST non-correlated to AI semi volatility (held up far better during June 5 AI semi selloff — −2.0% vs NVDA −4.4%).

**Result: 4 of 5 criteria met (strategy requires ≥3) → QUALIFIES with noted technical caution.**

**Sizing:**
- 40 shares × ~$147 = ~$5,880 = **5.9% of portfolio** (starter conviction)
- Cash after fill: $78,705.60 − $5,880 = $72,825.60 = ~73.4% of equity >> 5% minimum ✓
- Daily deployment: $5,880 = 5.9% of portfolio ≤ 25% cap ✓
- Single position cap: 5.9% ≤ 20% cap ✓
- Sector diversification: Adds Energy/Utilities. Current sectors: Healthcare (LLY 11.65%), Ad-tech (META 8.97%). VST brings sector balance ✓

**Stop:** 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.

**Entry condition:** VST must open at or above $145. If VST opens below $145 (making new lows), defer to Wednesday. This ensures we're not buying into a gap-down.

**Invalidation criteria:** WTI crude >$100 (macro shock), VST cuts FCF guidance, AI hyperscaler PPA cancellation or major modification, VST breaks below $130 on volume.

**This is Slot 1 of 3 for week of June 8.**

---

**Slot 2 — V (Visa): DEFER AGAIN**
- V closed $319.72 (June 8) — BELOW CFO's May 12 sale price of $324.88. Mildly concerning (CFO sold at $324.88 believing that was a fair price; V has since dropped −$5.16 = −1.6% from his sale level).
- CEO Ryan McInerney exercised options and sold 31,455 shares at $340.14 on April 29 under a **10b5-1 plan dated May 15, 2025** — PLANNED, not discretionary.
- CFO Chris Suh sold 10,639 shares at $324.88 on May 12 via **open-market transaction** — NO 10b5-1 confirmation found. This was after the CEO's planned 10b5-1 sale, suggesting the CFO acted independently.
- The CFO sold 51.9% of his directly held stake at market highs ($324.88) via what appears to be a discretionary open-market sale. This is the most meaningful negative insider signal.
- **Decision: DEFER V until CFO situation resolves.** May re-evaluate next week if V Form 4 details confirm 10b5-1, or if a new positive catalyst outweighs the insider signal.

---

**Slot 3 — LRCX (Lam Research): DEFER**
- June 8 close: need to check, but June 5 was $303.26 (−9.87% from $336.44 June 4).
- NVDA CEO declined Senate testimony → slightly positive for AI semis broadly, but LRCX still needs time to base.
- RSI was elevated even after the drop (70-72 on longer timeframe). Not enough consolidation yet.
- **Decision: DEFER. Target re-evaluation late next week once post-hearing sentiment clarifies.**

---

### Performance estimate (pre-market June 9)

- **Bull equity pre-market:** $99,135.90 (−0.87% since inception)
- **SPY estimate:** ~$744 (futures +0.71% on June 8 close $739.30) = +0.62% since inception
- **Estimated gap:** ~−1.49% (widened slightly from −0.96% at June 8 close as SPY gapped up strongly)
- Note: Gap widening is expected when market recovers sharply and Bull holds 79% cash. This will narrow as new positions are deployed.

---

### Planned trades for today (Tuesday June 9, 2026)

**Primary: BUY VST 40 shares at market open — CONDITIONAL**

**Thesis for VST starter:**
Nuclear power operator with locked 20-year PPAs with Meta + Amazon for AI data-center baseload electricity. The secular AI power demand story is the mirror image of the hyperscaler AI infra build — someone has to power those data centers reliably, and VST owns contracted nuclear capacity to do exactly that. Q1 adj EBITDA +20% YoY confirms the financial momentum. At $147 vs $220+ consensus target, the market is still valuing this as a traditional utility. Non-correlated to AI semi volatility — portfolio diversification benefit.

**Entry condition:** VST opens at or above $145. If VST opens below $145, defer to Wednesday.
**Size:** 40 shares (whole shares, trailing-stop eligible).
**Stop:** 10% trailing stop placed immediately after fill.
**Slot:** 1 of 3 for week of June 8.

**Secondary: HOLD LLY and META.**
- LLY: Let trailing stops ratchet with price. Retatrutide ADA data is fresh positive news — thesis strengthening.
- META: Stop at $578.142 is active. Pre-market recovery +1.13% is encouraging. Enterprise AI agent launch is a new positive. Hold and let stop manage risk. Do NOT manually intervene.

**Explicit non-trades:**
- V (Visa): DEFER. CFO 51.9% open-market stake sale unresolved.
- LRCX: DEFER. Still needs basing action.
- No NVDA re-entry yet (hearing June 11 still pending even without CEO testimony).

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- **NVDA Senate Banking hearing June 11** — proceeds without CEO Huang; watch for market reaction
- **META dividend ex-date ~June 15** ($0.525/sh × 15sh = $7.875 credit)
- **LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1** — now 22 days away
- **Existing home sales + NFIB today** — minor macro releases

## 2026-06-08 — Pre-market research (~08:12 ET)

**Today is Monday June 8. Week of June 8: 0/3 new positions used. 3 fresh slots.**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: WTI OIL AT $93.67 — Approaching $100 halt trigger

Iran and Israel exchanged strikes over the weekend (June 7–8 local time). WTI crude futures jumped **+3.46% to $93.67** (Brent $96.47). This is only **$6.33 below the $100 halt-new-buys trigger**. The direction is upward. This dramatically changes new-buy appetite for today — no new positions until oil direction clarifies.

### Macro (pre-market June 8, 2026 ~08:12 ET)

| Indicator | Value | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| WTI crude oil | **$93.67** (+3.46% today) | <$100 halt-new-buys | ⚠️ RISING FAST — $6.33 below trigger |
| Brent crude | $96.47 | — | ⚠️ Iran/Israel escalation |
| S&P 500 futures / SPY pre-mkt | $742.81 (+0.73% from Jun 5 close $737.45) | — | ✓ Slightly constructive |
| 10yr Treasury yield | ~4.47% est (post-NFP, stable over weekend) | <4.75% watch | ✓ Constructive |
| Iran/Israel | Exchanged strikes Jun 7–8 — fragile ceasefire threatened | Oil <$100 | ⚠️ HIGH ALERT |
| MRVL | +9% pre-mkt (added to S&P 500 Jun 22) | — | ✓ Positive for semis broadly |

**Macro posture: Cautious.** Iran/Israel escalation creates oil-price risk. WTI at $93.67 with upward trajectory means no new buys today. Market is slightly up pre-market (S&P futures edging higher) but Iran/oil is the dominant risk factor. Hold positions; research candidates for later this week.

### New position research

**Slot 1 — V (Visa): CONTINUE DEFER**
- Q2 FY2026: Net revenue $11.2B (+17% YoY), EPS $3.31 (beat by 2.8%). $20B buyback authorized.
- Held up well June 5 (closed $323.66, essentially flat vs market −2.41%) — positive relative strength.
- ⚠️ **CFO Chris Suh: open-market sale of 10,639 shares @ $324.88 on May 12, 2026 — total $3.46M.**
  After sale, holds only 9,872 shares. Pre-sale position: ~20,511 shares. **SOLD 51.9% of his stake.**
  This is an open-market transaction — NOT confirmed as 10b5-1 plan. No secondary insiders confirmed selling, but this is a single CFO disposing of >50% of holdings at highs. Highly concerning.
- Visa stock at $323.66 (June 5) — around the CFO's sale price. If the CFO thought $324 was a good sale price, that's a valuation signal.
- **Decision: DEFER again.** Research whether sale was 10b5-1 plan-based or discretionary. Need to verify. Will not buy until CFO concern resolved.

**Slot 2 — LRCX (Lam Research): DEFER**
- June 5 close: $303.26. LRCX fell **−9.87% on June 5** (from $336.44 June 4) — massive single-session selloff.
- Prior to that: all-time high close $343.71 (June 3). Stock went $343 → $303 in two sessions = −11.7%.
- RSI at ~71-72 (approaching overbought) even after the drop — still technically extended on longer timeframe.
- 52-week return +304.79% — massive run before correction.
- Semi equipment sector faces near-term headwinds: NVDA Senate Banking hearing June 11 (regulatory noise), Iran/Israel geopolitical uncertainty.
- Entry signal #4 (technical): stock needs to stabilize/base before clean entry. −9.87% in one day is not a controlled pullback.
- Strategy.md: "not extended >10% above its 50-day moving average." Need 50-day SMA data — but after a +304% run, the 50-day is far below current levels. The stock is likely still well above it even at $303.
- **Decision: DEFER. Wait for stable basing action. Could revisit Tuesday/Wednesday once Iran/oil settles and semi sector finds a floor post-NVDA hearing.**

**Slot 3 — VST (Vistra Energy): RESEARCH CANDIDATE for mid-week**
- Current price: $148.75 (June 5 close). Down 7% YTD.
- Strong Buy consensus from 19 analysts. Avg target $225.29 (51% upside).
- Q1 2026: EPS $1.46 vs $1.32 est (+10.52% surprise). Revenue $5.64B vs $5.22B est (+8.0%).
- 20-year PPAs with Meta (AI data centers) and Amazon for PJM nuclear power.
- Restarting Perry nuclear plant (additional baseload capacity for AI power demand).
- **Iran/Israel impact:** WTI spiking today is bullish for natural gas prices and VST's conventional fleet. However, macro uncertainty may weigh on the stock short-term. Want to see how VST opens today before committing.
- Non-correlated to AI semi sector (didn't correlate with the June 5 AI semi selloff as badly as NVDA/MSFT/AVGO).
- Entry signal check:
  1. Earnings momentum: Q1 +10.52% EPS beat ✓
  2. Clear catalyst: 20-yr PPAs with Meta+Amazon locked; nuclear restart; AI power demand secular ✓
  3. Valuation: At $148, FY26 FCF yield looks attractive. 51% upside to consensus $225 target ✓
  4. Technical: Stock down 7% YTD in rising market = lagging. Need 50-day SMA confirmation.
  5. Macro: Iran/Israel adds near-term uncertainty but could BENEFIT VST (rising energy prices)
- **Decision: RESEARCH for Tuesday/Wednesday buy once WTI direction clarifies and VST opens cleanly.**
  Starter size would be 40-45 shares (~$6,000-6,700 = 6-7% of portfolio). Full thesis pending.

**Also consider (not yet researched for week of June 8):**
- **COST (Costco):** Consumer defensive. Q4 FY2026 earnings due mid-August — but pre-earn entry possible.
- **META add?** If META recovers past $620 (back above entry), a scale-up could be considered.

---

### Planned trades for today (Monday June 8, 2026)

**No new positions today.**

WTI crude at $93.67 (+3.46%) due to Iran/Israel strikes is approaching the $100 halt-new-buys trigger. Entering new positions into a macro shock day is poor process. All three slot candidates (V, LRCX, VST) require more research or cleaner technical setups.

- **LLY:** Hold. Approaching HWM $1,166.29 (+1.70% pre-mkt). Let stops ratchet if LLY breaks the HWM today. No manual intervention needed.
- **META:** Hold. Above $582 alert — constructive recovery. Monitor if META drifts toward $582 intraday. Stop at $578.142. If META opens strongly, watch for HWM approach ($642.38 is far away).
- **All 3 stops active** (d4147484, 25989fb5, 4ea07e91) — confirmed via Alpaca ✓

**Planned for Tuesday/Wednesday:**
- Research VST (Vistra) fully — complete pre-trade checklist. Target entry if WTI stabilizes below $95, macro settles.
- Check Visa Form 4 details — was May 12 sale a 10b5-1 plan or discretionary? This determines whether V slot can open.
- Monitor LRCX for stable base after -9.87% June 5 drop.
- Watch NVDA Senate Banking hearing June 11 — potential catalyst for AI semi recovery or further pressure.

**Upcoming catalysts (week of June 8):**
- META dividend ex-date ~June 15 ($0.525/sh × 15sh = $7.875 credit)
- LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program effective July 1
- NVDA Senate Banking Committee hearing June 11 — regulatory noise
- Iran/Israel ceasefire status — key oil price driver
- V (Visa) Form 4 investigation — determines slot availability

## 2026-06-05 — Pre-market research (~08:08 ET)

**Today is Friday June 5. Week of June 1: 1/3 new positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining.**

### CRITICAL EVENT: May Nonfarm Payrolls — due 8:30 AM ET today

The NFP report drops 22 minutes from now. This is the dominant macro event for today and the swing
factor for whether to execute the LLY scale-up at the 9:35 AM open.

**Pre-release consensus:**
- NFP expected: 85K–125K (FactSet median 105K; FXStreet 85K)
- April actual: +115K; March: +178K
- Unemployment rate: 4.3% expected (unchanged)
- Average Hourly Earnings: +3.4% YoY expected (vs +3.6% April) — softening
- Article headline: "NFP set to show US job creation slowed in May, yet not enough to shift Fed's hawkish tilt"

**S&P 500 futures: -0.61% pre-NFP** — market cautious but not alarmed (also dragged by Lululemon
earnings miss/guidance cut after close June 4).

**NFP decision rule for LLY scale-up:**
- **PROCEED with LLY scale-up** if: jobs 50K–250K, AHE not shocking (monthly < 0.4%), 10yr stays
  below 4.75% post-release
- **HOLD (no trades)** if: jobs < 50K (recession fear) OR jobs > 300K + hot wages (hawkish shock)
  OR 10yr crosses 4.75% post-NFP

**LLY ($1,137.24 pre-mkt, +1.06% today, +5.99% from entry $1,072.944):** ⭐ SCALE-UP CANDIDATE
- CVS Health announced "fantastic news" on June 5 (Motley Fool headline) — likely related to
  Zepbound/Foundayo coverage expansion. Reinforces the Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 Bridge July 1 thesis.
- Lilly cutting German investment (EUR 2.3B → ~EUR 1.15B) to focus on US manufacturing — capital
  discipline signal; redirecting to Pennsylvania site or new US facility.
- LLY approaching HWM $1,149.10 (currently $11.86 below it, 1.04%). If LLY breaks $1,149.10
  today, trailing stop ratchets higher automatically.
- GF Score 98 (GuruFocus) — exceptional fundamental quality rating.
- **Stop buffer:** $1,137.24 - $1,034.19 = $103.05 (9.1% from current price). Well protected. ✓
- **PLAN: ADD 3 shares at open (Slot 2) — subject to NFP being benign.**

**META ($624.30 pre-mkt, -0.52% today, +0.59% from entry $620.637):**
- Minor softness. No significant new catalysts. AI ad thesis intact.
- Dividend ex-date revised to June 15 (earlier than June 25 previously noted — confirm at open).
- Stop buffer: $624.30 - $578.142 = $46.16 (7.4%) ✓
- No action.

**MSFT ($429.55 pre-mkt, +0.35% today, +1.71% from entry $422.31):**
- Essentially flat, constructive. Morgan Stanley "time to act" — "bullish on upside potential."
- Azure AI thesis intact. Post-Build conference digestion ongoing.
- Stop buffer: $429.55 - $419.688 = $9.86 (2.3%) — narrow but within tolerance.
  Watch if NFP causes a broad risk-off that pushes MSFT down materially.
- No action.

**NVDA ($215.20 pre-mkt, -1.58% today, -0.51% from entry $216.302):** ⚠️ WATCH
- Down -1.58% pre-market. Specific catalyst: Senator Elizabeth Warren invited NVDA CEO Jensen
  Huang to testify before the Senate Banking Committee June 11 about China business and US export
  controls. This introduces regulatory overhang noise but is NOT a thesis break.
- AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact. China business hearing is a known risk, not new.
- Stop buffer: $215.20 - $209.052 = $6.15 (2.9%) — narrowing. With S&P futures -0.61%, NVDA
  could face additional pressure at open.
- **If NVDA opens ≤ $209.05, stop fires automatically. DO NOT intervene.**
- Ex-div credit $7.50 should have posted to cash; verify at market open.

### New position research

**Slot 2 — LLY scale-up (+3 shares):**
Fully researched above. Execute at open conditional on NFP.

**Slot 3 — V (Visa):**
- Q2 FY2026: Net revenue $11.2B (+17% YoY), non-GAAP EPS $3.31 (beat by 2.8%). $20B buyback authorized.
- Stock up +3.36% on June 4 — strong momentum.
- Payments infrastructure, sector diversification from AI-heavy book.
- ⚠️ **CONCERN: CFO Chris Suh reduced his position by >50% in May** (insider selling). Significant.
  Per strategy.md entry signals, insider selling clusters are a flag to "dig deeper." Not an
  automatic skip, but warrants scrutiny.
- **Decision: DEFER Visa to next week.** Insider selling flag is unresolved. With LLY scale-up
  already in plan for today, no need to rush Slot 3. Research V thoroughly next week before committing.

---

### Planned trades for today (Friday June 5, 2026)

**Primary: BUY LLY +3 shares at market open (Slot 2 of 3 for week of June 1) — CONDITIONAL**

**Thesis for LLY scale-up:**
GLP-1 franchise dominance is strengthening: Medicare/Medicaid GLP-1 Bridge program effective
July 1 expanding access to ~20-30M beneficiaries; all three major PBMs covering full Lilly portfolio;
CVS additional positive announcement today (June 5); Q1 revenue +56% YoY; GLP-1 market share 60.1%.
Stock at $1,137.24 pre-market is +5.99% from our entry — scale-up adds to a thesis that is
actively confirming. Adding to a winner on fundamental confirmation, not chasing.
Scale from 7 shares (7.97% portfolio weight) to 10 shares (~11.4% portfolio weight).

**Condition:** NFP must be in the "benign" range (50K–250K, AHE not shocking, 10yr stays below 4.75%).
The market-open routine should check the NFP result and 10yr yield at 9:35 AM before executing.

**Stop for added 3 shares:** Place new 10% trailing stop on 3 additional shares immediately after fill.
(Existing stop d4147484 covers 7 shares. Need separate stop for +3.)

**Secondary: HOLD all 4 existing positions.**
Watch NVDA at open — stop $209.052, 2.9% buffer.

**Slot 3 (V/Visa): DEFER to next week.** CFO insider selling requires more research.

**If NFP is NOT benign (yield spike >4.75%, or extreme print):**
- No new buys. Hold all positions. Tighten attention on NVDA stop.
- Flag in next routine.

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- May NFP **TODAY** 8:30 AM ET — gates today's trade
- META dividend ex-date likely June 15 (15sh × $0.525 = $7.875 credit) — verify at open
- LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program effective July 1
- NVDA Senate Banking Committee hearing June 11 (regulatory noise; not thesis break)
- V (Visa) — research for Slot 3 next week

### CRITICAL: AVGO earnings — post-earnings gap down

**AVGO reported Q2 FY2026 after close June 3. Results were MIXED:**

| Metric | Actual | Estimate / Guide | vs. Expectation |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Revenue | $22.19B | $22.27B est | Slight miss |
| EPS (adj) | $2.44 | $2.40 est | Beat ✓ |
| AI semiconductor revenue | $10.8B (+143% YoY) | $10.7B guide | Marginal beat ✓ |
| Infrastructure software | $7.18B | $7.32B est | **MISS** ✗ |
| Q3 revenue guidance | $29.4B | $28.53B est | Beat ✓ |
| Q3 AI semiconductor guide | $16.0B | >$11.5B threshold | Crushed threshold ✓ |
| Full-year AI semi guidance | Reaffirmed >$100B (FY2027) | Expected raise | **Not raised** ✗ |

**Market reaction: AVGO -14.93% pre-market at ~$408.98.**
- Stock gapped from official June 3 close ~$478.62 to ~$408-409 overnight
- "Buy the rumor, sell the news" — stock ran +17.98% from entry before print
- Software miss ($7.18B vs $7.32B) and failure to raise full-year AI guidance disappointed bulls
- Options implied ±10.65% move; actual move is ~15%

**AVGO trailing stop situation:**
- Stop (a8e344f4): HWM $495.00, stop **$445.50** — ACTIVE (confirmed in Alpaca orders)
- Pre-market AVGO: ~$408.98 — well below $445.50 stop
- **The trailing stop WILL FIRE at market open.** AVGO exits at ~$408-410 (gap risk: stop fills at market price, not $445.50)
- Result: 20 shares × ~($409 − $417.37) = ~**−$170 loss** from entry (−2.0%)
- This is gap risk — the stop protects against further decline but cannot prevent the gap itself

**Scale-up decision: DO NOT SCALE UP. CANCELLED.**
- Technical conditions were met (AI rev $10.8B > $10.7B guide; Q3 AI $16.0B >> $11.5B threshold)
- BUT: buying into a −15% post-earnings gapper is chasing a falling knife
- Market's verdict is clearly negative; software miss + guidance-not-raised disappointed
- Additionally, the trailing stop fires at open — AVGO exits automatically; can't scale up a closing position
- The scale-up plan's spirit was "add on confirmation with positive market reaction" — that condition is NOT met
- **No action needed. Trailing stop handles AVGO exit.**

---

### Macro (June 4, 2026 pre-market)

- **S&P futures:** Likely under pressure from AVGO's -15% move. AI semi sector broader sympathy selling possible.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** ~4.44–4.50% (constructive range, unchanged)
- **WTI crude:** **$95.68** — rising for 3rd consecutive session on US-Iran peace-talk uncertainty. Only $4.32 away from $100 halt-new-buys trigger. ⚠️ WATCH.
- **Market posture:** Cautious today. AVGO fallout will pressure AI/tech names at open. WTI elevated. No defensive pivot warranted but no new buys today.

| NVDA | 8c6b9680 | $232.28 | $209.052 | $212.53 | **−1.76%** | ⚠️ WATCH — 1.6% buffer |

**AVGO (~$408.98, trailing stop fires at open):**
- Trailing stop at $445.50 will execute at market open. Position closes at ~$408-410 (gap-filled below stop)
- Entry $417.37; proceeds ~$8,180; net loss from entry ~−$170 (−2.01% on cost basis)
- The big gain (+$1,357 at June 3 close) is wiped by the gap-down — this is gap risk
- THESIS STATUS: Mixed print. AI semi thesis partially intact (Q3 $16B guide is extraordinary) but software miss and FY guidance not raised weaken the thesis. Not a name to reload in the short term.
- **NO scale-up. Let stop execute.**

**META (~$618.24, −0.76% today, −0.39% from entry $620.64):**
- Minor softness, consistent with AI-sector sympathy selling
- Stop $562.329 ($55.91 above current — safe 8.3% buffer). Thesis intact.
- No action.

**MSFT (~$433.50, +1.44% today, +2.65% from entry $422.31):**
- Strong pre-market recovery. AVGO earnings' Q3 AI revenue guide ($16B) is bullish for MSFT's Azure AI demand
- Stop $419.688 ($13.81 above current — safe 3.3% buffer). Thesis intact.
- No action.

**LLY (~$1,098.51, +1.83% today, +2.38% from entry $1,072.94):**
- Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program July 1 catalyst confirmed. Medicare/Medicaid coverage agreement
  announced — estimated 20–30M Medicare beneficiaries eligible. LLY 2026 revenue guidance $80–83B.
- Strong pre-market move validating thesis.
- HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($64.32 above current — safe 6.2% buffer). Thesis STRONGEST in portfolio.
- No action. Could scale up to 10% with Slot 2 or 3 — evaluate at June 5 pre-market.

**NVDA (~$212.53, −1.05% today, −1.76% from entry $216.302):** ⚠️ WATCH
- Stop $209.052; buffer only $3.48 = 1.6%.
- AI sector selling at open (AVGO fallout) could pressure NVDA toward the stop.
- Ex-dividend credit $7.50 (30sh × $0.25) should post today or next business day.
- Thesis intact (AI accelerator monopoly, no credible competitor). Stop is there for a reason — let it run.
- **Key watch at open.** If NVDA opens ≤$209.05, stop fires. DO NOT intervene.

### New position research

**No new positions today.** Reasons:
1. AVGO gap-down creates AI sector uncertainty at open — observe before deploying
2. NVDA's stop buffer is critically narrow; watch first
3. WTI $95.68 is approaching $100 halt trigger — no new buys until oil direction clarifies
4. After AVGO stop fires, cash rises to ~$67K (68%); plenty of room — no urgency
5. Slots 2 and 3 remain available; better to deploy with higher conviction next week or after sector settles

**Candidate evaluation deferred to June 5 pre-market:**
- **LLY scale-up** (+3 shares, ~10% portfolio weight) — Medicare July 1 catalyst, thesis strengthening
- **V (Visa)** — payments infrastructure, sector diversification from AI-heavy book
- Re-evaluate after AVGO and NVDA situations resolve today

---

### Planned trades for today (Thursday June 4, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

The AVGO trailing stop (a8e344f4, stop $445.50) will execute automatically at market open — no action needed from me. AVGO position closes at ~$408-410. No scale-up.

Watch NVDA at open: stop $209.052, pre-market $212.53 (1.6% buffer). Potential AI-sector sympathy selling from AVGO fallout. DO NOT manually intervene; let the trailing stop protect if triggered.

All other positions (MSFT, META, LLY) have adequate stop buffers (3.3%, 8.3%, 6.2% respectively).

**Post-AVGO-exit portfolio plan:**
- 4 positions remain (MSFT, META, LLY, NVDA — contingent on NVDA stop not triggering)
- Cash rises to ~$67,480 (68%)
- No new positions this week. Evaluate at June 5 pre-market.
- **Slot 2:** LLY scale-up +3 shares OR new name — decide June 5
- **Slot 3:** V (Visa) or other name — decide June 5+

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- NVDA ex-dividend credit $7.50 today (June 4) or next business day
- META dividend payable June 25 ($7.875)
- LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program effective July 1
- May nonfarm payrolls (Friday June 5) — key macro read

## 2026-06-03 — Pre-market research (~08:07 ET)

**Today is Wednesday June 3. Week of June 1: 1/3 new positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining.**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 futures:** -0.11% (S&P futures 7,615.50, -8.25 pts). Dow futures -0.3%, Nasdaq flat.
  All three major indices closed at all-time highs June 2. Taking a breather pre-open. No defensive
  signal — constructive risk-on environment continues.
- **SPY pre-market:** ~$760 (June 2 close $759.47). Since inception $739.44 → SPY +2.71%.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** ~4.4–4.5% range (constructive, below 4.75% halt-new-buys trigger). ✓
- **WTI crude:** ⚠️ $93.64–$96.04, rising for a 3rd consecutive session. Gaining on ongoing
  US-Iran peace-talk uncertainty. Still below $100 watch level but **direction is upward**.
  This reduces appetite for new buys today and adds urgency to monitoring the threshold.
  Watch trigger unchanged: halt new buys if WTI crosses $100.
- **Economic data today:** ADP private payrolls (May); durable goods and factory orders (April).
- **Market posture:** Constructive, but with rising oil acting as a modest headwind. No defensive
  pivot required — broad market at ATH. AVGO earnings tonight is the dominant event.

### Held positions (pre-market June 3, 2026 — live Alpaca data 08:07 ET)

**Account:** Equity $101,380.98 | Cash $51,823.36 (51.1%) | Long market value $49,557.62

| NVDA | 8c6b9680 | $232.28 | $209.052 | $224.20 | +3.65% |

**AVGO ($492.42 pre-mkt, +2.25% today, +17.98% from entry $417.37):** ⭐ KEY EVENT TONIGHT
- EARNINGS AFTER CLOSE TONIGHT (2 PM PT / 5 PM ET). Options imply ±10.65% post-earnings move.
- **Consensus:** Revenue $22.08B (guided $22.0B, +47% YoY); EPS $2.40 (range $2.36–$2.54).
- **KEY METRIC: Q2 AI semiconductor revenue.** Broadcom guided $10.7B for Q2 in its March Q1 report
  (+140% YoY vs $4.6B in Q2 FY25). This is the number the market is watching — does the actual
  print beat this guide, and what does Q3/FY guidance look like?
  - ⚠️ **NOTE: Prior strategy.md scale plan used ">$5B AI revenue" as the bar — this was outdated.**
  The Q2 guide itself was $10.7B. The real bar for tonight is: (1) AI revenue BEATS $10.7B, and
  (2) Q3 AI guidance is raised materially above $10.7B.
- Custom silicon roster: 4 hyperscaler customers now (Alphabet TPU v7 locked for 2027, Meta MTIA
  accelerating, ByteDance ASIC announced May — NEW 4th hyperscaler). CEO Hock Tan: "line of sight
  to $100B+ AI chip revenue in 2027."
- AVGO pre-market $492.42 is ABOVE yesterday broker HWM $488.82 → broker will ratchet HWM to
  ~$492.42+ at open → stop ratchets to ~$443.18 (still 10% below new HWM). No action needed.
- **+15% tighten rule:** AVGO is now +17.98% from entry ($417.37 × 1.15 = $479.98). Rule would
  normally apply. WAIVED — earnings tonight. Tightening from 10% to 7% risks being stopped out
  on post-earnings volatility. Existing 10% stop locks in ~+8% from entry if triggered.
- **DO NOT ADD before earnings.** Post-earnings scale plan below.

**MSFT ($439.87 pre-mkt, −0.33% today, +4.16% from entry $422.31):**
- Build Day 2 (TODAY, Fort Mason SF). Major announcements confirmed day 2:
  - **Autopilots** — new category of always-on AI agents with Entra ID governance (Microsoft Scout)
  - **GitHub Copilot** — native desktop app (Windows/Mac/Linux), Autopilot mode, parallel sessions
  - **Azure AI Foundry** — Hosted Agents reaching GA end of June 2026; hypervisor-isolated runtime
  - **Aion 1.0** — 14B parameter reasoning model ships in-box with Windows for on-device AI
  - **Fabric Data Warehouse** — GPU-accelerated, 7× faster than cloud peers
- Theme: AI moves from passive assistants → autonomous agents running entire workflows.
- MSFT mildly soft pre-market (−0.33%). Build Day 1 "sell the news" pattern appears to be
  moderating. Stop $419.688 is $20.18 below current — safe. Thesis STRONGER after Day 2 reveals.
- No action needed.

**META ($602.69 pre-mkt, +0.85% today, −2.89% from entry $620.64):**
- Recovering. Quarterly dividend $0.525/sh payable June 25 (15sh × $0.525 = $7.875 credit).
- HWM $624.81, stop $562.329 ($40.36 above current). AI ad moat thesis intact.
- No action needed.

**LLY ($1,066.46 pre-mkt, +0.22% today, −0.60% from entry $1,072.94):**
- Stable. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program effective July 1 (expanding access for Medicare patients
  through 2027). All three major PBMs covering full LLY portfolio. Phase 3 Libretto-432 met
  primary endpoint. Thesis is strongest long-term in portfolio.
- HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19 ($32.27 above current — 3.0% buffer).
- No action needed.

**AMZN ($256.01 pre-mkt, −0.20% today, −4.88% from entry $269.13):** ⚠️ WATCH
- Continued softness. Headwinds: regulatory scrutiny (European AWS government contract risk),
  heavy capex cycle depressing FCF, AWS "regretted attrition" concerns, child-safety lawsuits.
- Positives: Prime Day June 23–26 catalyst; strong Q1 results; AWS backlog $364B; 57/60 analysts
  buy, avg target $312+.
- **Cut threshold: $250.29 (entry $269.13 × 0.93). Current $256.01 = $5.72 above cut.**
- Stop $247.275 ($8.74 below current).
- **AT MIDDAY CHECK: close AMZN if price < $250.29 per −7% rule.**

**NVDA ($224.20 pre-mkt, +0.62% today, +3.65% from entry $216.302):**
- **EX-DIVIDEND TODAY.** $0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit to account (typically posted same-day or
  next business day on paper trading). Stock will open slightly below yesterday's close adjusted
  for the dividend, which is normal — not a thesis break.
- HWM $232.28, stop $209.052 ($15.15 below current — safe).
- No action needed.

### New position research

**No new positions today.** Rationale:
1. AVGO earnings tonight — preserve both remaining slots for the post-earnings scale plan
2. WTI oil at $95/bbl and rising; an additional buy before seeing AVGO results adds unnecessary risk
3. Forcing a new entry the same day as the week's most important earnings is poor process

---

### Planned trades for today (Wednesday June 3, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

All 6 positions held with trailing stops. AVGO earnings tonight is the pivotal event of the week.
AMZN watch: close at midday if below $250.29.
NVDA ex-dividend today: USD 7.50 credit.

**Post-AVGO scale plan (June 4 open) — REVISED:**
- ⚠️ Previous plan used ">$5B AI revenue" as the beat threshold — outdated. Company-guided
  Q2 AI semiconductor revenue was $10.7B (provided in Q1 March report, +140% YoY).
- **New scale trigger:** Q2 AI semiconductor revenue BEATS $10.7B guide AND Q3 AI guidance
  raised meaningfully (guide >$11.5B or FY trajectory raised). BOTH conditions must hold.
  If met: ADD 8–10 shares AVGO at limit ~0.3% below opening quote at June 4 open (~$3,900–$5,000
  at ~$490-500 est.). Scales position from ~9.7% to ~12–14% of portfolio. Uses slot 2.
- **If in-line/miss on AI revenue OR guidance flat/lower:** HOLD existing 20sh with trailing stop.
  Do not add. Let stop protect +8%+ gain from entry.

**Slot 3 (remaining):** After AVGO result, evaluate:
- LLY scale-up (+3 shares ~$3,200 → ~10% portfolio weight)
- V (Visa) new name if macro stable
- Defer to June 5 pre-market research.

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- **AVGO earnings TONIGHT June 3** — KEY WEEK EVENT
- NVDA ex-dividend TODAY ($7.50 credit)
- MSFT Build Day 2 ongoing announcements (autonomous agents, Copilot desktop)
- META dividend payable June 25 ($7.875)
- LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1
- ADP jobs data, factory orders (today)

## 2026-06-02 — Pre-market research (~08:07 ET)

**Today is Tuesday June 2. Week of June 1: 1/3 new positions used (META June 1). 2 slots remaining.**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 futures:** +0.2%; Nasdaq futures +0.3%. SPY pre-market $756.75 (−0.22% from June 1 close
  $758.44). Broad market off slightly overnight. Market closed June 1 at fresh record highs (10th
  consecutive weekly gain confirmed). No defensive signal.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** 4.46% (+0.01% from prior session) — well below 4.75% watch level.
  Constructive for AI multiples. No stop tightening warranted.
- **Iran — REVERSAL:** Iran suspended communications with Washington June 1, citing US "mixed
  signals." WTI crude surged 6–8% to ~$92/bbl on June 1 (up from ~$87.66). Still below our $100
  watch level. Trump later indicated Lebanon/Hezbollah ceasefire agreed and talks continuing, which
  pulled WTI off session highs. Net: Iran deal trajectory now LESS certain. WTI at $92 is fine
  for now, but the direction reversed. Watch if it re-approaches $100.
- **MSFT Build 2026 — Day 1 TODAY:** Microsoft Build conference at Fort Mason Center, San Francisco.
  Satya Nadella keynote at 9:30 AM PT (12:30 PM ET). Key announcements: new in-house AI coding model
  (addresses investor concern MSFT ceded AI coding to Anthropic/OpenAI), GitHub Copilot as autonomous
  agent, Azure AI Foundry enterprise orchestration dashboard, Copilot Runtime for Windows on-device AI.
  Morgan Stanley eyeing 52% Azure upside. MSFT down −2.46% pre-market ($449.19 from $460.52 last
  session) — likely "sell the news" ahead of conference; initial trading range $450–$472 per reports.
- **Market posture:** Risk-on with modest Iran uncertainty. No defensive pivot. AI sentiment remains
  high (NVDA Computex RTX Spark, MSFT Build, AVGO earnings tomorrow). Proceed with all 6 positions.

### Held positions (pre-market June 2, 2026 — live Alpaca data 08:07 ET)

**All 6 trailing stop orders confirmed ACTIVE (verified via Alpaca orders endpoint):**

| Symbol | Order ID | Live HWM | Live Stop | Pre-mkt price | vs Entry |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|

| MSFT | a55a3db6 | $466.32 | $419.688 | $449.19 | +6.37% |
| META | 4ea07e91 | $624.81 | $562.329 | $605.49 | −2.44% |
| LLY | d4147484 | $1,149.10 | $1,034.19 | $1,077.07 | +0.39% |
| AMZN | bbcd70fa | $274.75 | $247.275 | $257.35 | −4.38% |
| NVDA | 8c6b9680 | **$224.87** (ratcheted overnight) | **$202.383** | $227.35 | +5.11% |

**AVGO ($486.51 pre-mkt, +5.77% from $459.97 close, +16.57% from entry $417.37):**
- Extraordinary pre-market surge. Earnings TOMORROW June 3 after close (2 PM PT / 5 PM ET).
- Consensus: EPS $2.40 (+51.9% YoY), revenue $22.11B (+47% YoY). Buy-side bar: AI revenue >$5B
  (vs $4.1B in Q1). EPS consensus raised 11% over past 90 days — growing confidence.
- Broker ratcheted HWM overnight from $463.19 → $466.05. At $486.51, broker will ratchet
  HWM → $486.51+ at open → stop → ~$437.86 (10% below HWM).
- **HARD RULE: DO NOT ADD before earnings. Hold with trailing stop. Post-earnings scale plan below.**

**MSFT ($449.19 pre-mkt, −2.46% from $460.52, +6.37% from entry $422.31):**
- Pre-market softness on Build Day 1 open. Classic "sell the news" pattern at conference start.
- Conference runs today and tomorrow June 3 — new AI coding model, GitHub Copilot agent, Azure AI.
  Morgan Stanley raised target citing 52% Azure upside. Thesis very intact.
- Trailing stop HWM $466.32. Stop $419.688. MSFT at $449.19 is $29.73 above stop — safe. Stop
  will NOT ratchet today (MSFT below HWM). This is fine — trend is intact, just a pullback day.
- **Action: HOLD. No concern at this level.**

**META ($605.49 pre-mkt, +0.84% from $600.47, −2.44% from entry $620.64):**
- Recovering. META declared quarterly cash dividend $0.525/sh payable June 25 — modest positive.
- Thesis intact: AI-driven ad moat, +33% revenue, subscription layer, Llama flywheel. Current
  price $605.49 = $43.16 above stop $562.329. Safe. HWM $624.81 (only $19.32 above entry).
- **Action: HOLD. Normal early-position volatility.**

**LLY ($1,077.07 pre-mkt, −0.47% from $1,082.20, +0.39% from entry $1,072.94):**
- Mild softness. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program starts July 1 (new catalyst) — Medicare beneficiaries
  get discounted LLY obesity medicines through end of 2027. Materially expands access beyond commercial.
- CVS Foundayo coverage live since June 1. All three major PBMs now covering full portfolio.
- Phase 3 Libretto-432 trial (Retevmo) met primary endpoint May 31 — pipeline diversification catalyst.
- Trailing stop HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19. Current $1,077.07 = 4.2% above stop. Safe.
- **Action: HOLD. Thesis is the strongest long-term in the portfolio.**

**AMZN ($257.35 pre-mkt, −1.50% from $261.26, −4.38% from entry $269.13):** ⚠️ WATCH
- Drifting lower. Headwinds: European cloud regulations potentially limiting AWS government contracts,
  AWS outage May 7–8 (resolved), regretted attrition among senior AWS engineers noted.
- Near-term catalyst: Prime Day June 23–26 (moved back to June for first time since 2021).
- Cut threshold: entry $269.13 × 0.93 = $250.19. Current $257.35 = $7.16 above cut.
- Stop $247.275. Current = 4.1% above stop. Thesis (AWS $364B backlog, $100B Anthropic) intact.
  57/60 analysts buy, avg target $312.83.
- **Action: HOLD. Monitor intraday. If AMZN approaches $252–254, re-evaluate thesis.**

**NVDA ($227.35 pre-mkt, +1.33% from $224.36, +5.11% from entry $216.302):**
- Strong. Broker ratcheted HWM overnight $222.694 → $224.87, stop $200.42 → $202.383.
- At $227.35, broker will ratchet HWM → $227.35+ at open → stop → ~$204.62.
- Ex-dividend THURSDAY June 4: $0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit.
- RTX Spark momentum continues. Pre-market reportedly +6.25% around $229.72 per some sources
  (vs Alpaca's $227.35 at 8:07 AM — pre-market price may have moved after data pull).
- **Action: HOLD. Let trailing stop ratchet.**

### New position research

**No new position candidates for today.** Reasoning:
- AVGO earnings TOMORROW (June 3) — reserve 1 slot for post-earnings scale-up if strong beat.
- Iran oil trend reversal ($92 and rising vs falling): modest added uncertainty, prefer caution.
- 2 slots remaining. Optimal use:
  - Slot 2: AVGO scale-up June 4 open (if beat strongly: AI revenue >$5B, guidance raised)
  - Slot 3: New name research after AVGO print — candidates: LLY scale-up to 10%, V (Visa),
    COST (re-evaluate), or new name with fresh catalyst.
- Forcing a new entry today, before the week's pivotal earnings event, is suboptimal.

### Guardrail check

### Planned trades for today (Tuesday June 2, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

All 6 positions intact. AVGO earnings tomorrow is the dominant week event — do not add concentration
before the print. Iran oil reversal introduces modest caution. AMZN drifting toward watch territory
but well above −7% cut threshold and stop. All stops confirmed active.

**Post-AVGO plan (June 4 open):**
- **Strong beat** (AI revenue >$5B, guidance raised, hyperscaler commentary positive): Scale AVGO
  toward 12–14%. Currently 20sh × ~$490 = 9.6%. Add 8–10 shares (~$3,900–$4,900) for 10.4–11.4%.
  → Uses 1 position slot (slot 2 of week). Thesis: AI custom silicon monopoly with multi-year
  hyperscaler ASIC demand; earnings confirmation of the investment thesis.
- **In-line or miss:** Hold existing 20sh with trailing stop. Do not add. Let stop protect gains.

**Upcoming catalysts:**
- MSFT Build Day 2 June 3 — continued developer AI announcements.
- **AVGO earnings June 3 (after close)** — KEY WEEK EVENT.
- **NVDA ex-dividend June 4** — $0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit.
- META dividend payable June 25 ($0.525/sh × 15sh = $7.875).
- LLY Medicare GLP-1 Bridge program July 1.

## 2026-06-01 — Pre-market research (~08:07 ET)

**Today is Monday June 1 — first trading day of week of June 1. Weekly new-position count: 0/3 used. 1 slot carried from last week (COST/MRVL both skipped).**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 futures:** +0.2%; Dow futures +227 pts (+0.4%). SPY pre-market ~$758.34 (+0.26% from Friday close $756.34).
  Strong May recap: Nasdaq +8%, S&P 500 +5%, Dow +3% — market at/near ATH heading into June.
  Constructive risk-on open. No defensive signals.
- **NVDA RTX Spark — Computex 2026 keynote TODAY:** NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the RTX Spark superchip
  at Computex in Taipei: Arm-based N1X processor co-developed with Microsoft. Launching in laptops from
  Microsoft, Dell, HP, ASUS, Lenovo, MSI. 1 petaflop AI performance, up to 128GB unified memory. Company
  entering the PC CPU market (challenging Intel, AMD, Qualcomm). "Reinvention of the computer as big as
  the smartphone." Arm Holdings, HPE, ServiceNow, IBM also surging. **NVDA +2.17% pre-market to $215.725.**
- **MSFT Build conference June 2–3 (tomorrow–Wednesday):** MSFT will unveil a new in-house AI coding model —
  addresses investor concern that MSFT ceded AI coding market to Anthropic/others. Snowflake's Q1 results
  ("enterprise AI demand at clear inflection point") vindicated MSFT's $190B AI capex thesis.
  **MSFT +3.89% pre-market to $467.76** — massive move, new equity high. Azure AI secular thesis fully intact.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** ~4.48–4.50% (last week), well below 4.75% watch level. No macro concern.
- **Iran / WTI:** Tentative deal framework progress continues. WTI ~$87/bbl area. Below $100 watch. Constructive.
- **LLY CVS Foundayo coverage: EFFECTIVE TODAY.** CVS Caremark commercial template coverage for Foundayo
  begins June 1. All three largest US PBMs will cover LLY's full obesity medicine portfolio. Eligible
  commercially insured patients may pay as low as $25/month. Major commercial access catalyst — going live today.
- **Goldman Sachs S&P 500 target 8,000** (raised from 7,600 on May 27). Broad market bullish.
- **Market posture:** Decidedly risk-on. AI sentiment high (NVDA Computex, MSFT Build imminent), macro
  constructive (low yields, falling oil, benign PCE), market at ATH starting the month strongly.
  No defensive pivot warranted. Full risk-on posture appropriate.

### Held positions (pre-market June 1, 2026)

**Trailing stop orders — ALL 5 CONFIRMED ACTIVE (verified via Alpaca orders endpoint):**

| Symbol | Order ID | HWM (actual) | Stop | Pre-mkt price | vs Entry |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------------|---------|
| AVGO | a8e344f4 | **$448.88** | **$403.99** | $456.83 | +9.46% |
| MSFT | a55a3db6 | **$450.33** | **$405.30** | $467.76 | +10.76% |

| NVDA | 8c6b9680 | $218.18 | $196.36 | $215.725 | −0.27% |

_Note: MSFT HWM ratcheted to $450.33 and AMZN to $274.75 by broker at Friday EOD — higher than
portfolio.md had recorded. AVGO HWM ratcheted to $448.88. All stops will ratchet further at open
given strong pre-market: MSFT→~$421, AVGO→~$411._

**AVGO ($456.83 pre-mkt, +2.25%, +9.46% from entry):**
- Strong pre-market momentum ahead of June 3 earnings.
- UBS raised target to $490, consensus "Strong Buy." AI revenue +106% in latest quarter.
- **DO NOT ADD — earnings June 3 (2 trading days). Hold.** Stop ratchets ~$411 at open.

**MSFT ($467.76 pre-mkt, +3.89%, +10.76% from entry):**
- MASSIVE move: Snowflake Q1 "enterprise AI inflection point" vindicated capex; MSFT Build June 2–3
  with new AI coding model announcement; Pershing Square stake; $1B EY partnership.
- New HWM will be ~$467-468+ at open → stop ratchets to ~$421+.
- Azure AI thesis: STRONGEST conviction in the portfolio today. Hold and let broker ratchet stop.

**LLY ($1,098.01 pre-mkt, −0.63%, +2.34% from entry):**
- CVS Foundayo coverage live today — **catalyst is real but stock is mildly soft** (−0.63%).
  Suggests this was largely priced in after the May 28 ATH announcement. Prior HWM: $1,149.10.
  LLY is $51 (4.4%) below its HWM — some mean-reversion underway.
- Thesis still strongest in portfolio long-term. No scale-up today — wait for post-CVS
  momentum to rebuild. Stop at $1,034.19 is safe (current $1,098 = 6.2% above stop).

**AMZN ($268.22 pre-mkt, −0.89%, −0.34% from entry):**
- Mild softness. No negative catalyst. Prime Day moved to June (slight positive for retail).
  Truist raised target $310→$320. AWS $364B backlog thesis intact. Hold.
  HWM $274.75, stop $247.28. Current is 8.5% above stop — safe.

**NVDA ($215.725 pre-mkt, +2.17%, −0.27% from entry):**
- **NEW CATALYST:** RTX Spark chip at Computex 2026 — entering PC CPU market. NVDA +2.17% pre-mkt.
  This is an incremental positive for long-term addressable market expansion.
  Ex-dividend June 4 ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50). HWM $218.18, stop $196.36.
  If NVDA clears $218.18 today, stop ratchets higher — watch.

### New position research: META

**META Platforms — primary candidate for the week of June 1 carried slot**

**Fundamentals:**
- Q1 2026 revenue: $56.3B (+33% YoY) — beat consensus. Ad impressions +19%, pricing +12%.
  AI-driven ad targeting is driving higher advertiser ROI → advertisers bid up prices willingly.
- 2026 capex guidance raised to $125-145B (from $115-135B) — some investor concern but market
  has accepted it; META recovered from any post-Q1 dip to reach $635+ by late May.
- May 27: Global launch of Instagram Plus and Facebook Plus ($3.99/month each) — adds
  recurring subscription revenue layer. META surged 4% on the announcement.
- Llama open-source AI flywheel: drives developer adoption, creates enterprise AI ecosystem
  that funnels back to Meta's advertising and communication platforms.

**Analyst consensus:**
- 64 analysts: "Strong Buy" consensus. Average 12-month target: $826.75 (31% upside vs $632).
- Target range: $825-$880 with bulls reaching $1,086.
- Oppenheimer, UBS, Cantor Fitzgerald all maintaining positive coverage.

**Valuation:**
- At $632, with ~$30 EPS estimate for 2026, forward P/E ≈ 21x — reasonable for 30%+ revenue grower.
- P/E to growth (PEG) ≈ 21x / 33x growth ≈ 0.64 — well below 2.5x threshold. ✓

**Entry signal check (need ≥3 of 5):**
1. Earnings momentum: Q1 +33% revenue beat, subscription launch catalyst ✓
2. Clear catalyst: MSFT Build sentiment lift (enterprise AI demand confirmed); Llama adoption flywheel;
   subscription revenue launch May 27 ✓
3. Valuation: Forward P/E ~21x, PEG 0.64 — reasonable for 30%+ grower ✓
4. Technical: At $632-635, META is trending up from ~$607 area (4% higher in 2 weeks). Above recent
   support. Not overextended (4% rise from prior level). ✓
5. Macro tailwind: AI ad market secular tailwind intact; risk-on environment; NVDA/MSFT both surging ✓
**Result: 5 of 5 criteria met → PROCEED.**

**Sizing:**
- 15 shares × ~$633 = ~$9,495 = 9.3% of portfolio [$101,829] → starter "high conviction" position.
- Within 20% cap. Within 25% daily deployment cap ($9,495 is 9.3% of $101,829; cap = $25,457).
- Cash after fill: $61,132.91 − $9,495 ≈ $51,638 (50.7% of portfolio) — above 5% minimum. ✓
- Sector check: Adding ad-tech (META) alongside AI-infra (AVGO, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA) + healthcare (LLY).
  META is ad-tech/social, not direct AI-semi — adds sector diversification. ✓
- Tech/AI concentration after META: (AVGO 8.97% + MSFT 9.19% + AMZN 7.90% + NVDA 6.35% + META 9.3%)
  = ~41.7% — note this approaches the 35% heuristic. However META is ad-tech, not AI-semi.
  AI-semi specifically (AVGO + NVDA) = 15.3%, which is healthy. Cloud+AI-infra (MSFT + AMZN) = 17.1%.
  The 41.7% is tech-broad but diversified across sub-sectors. OK to proceed at starter sizing.

**Stop:** 10% trailing stop placed immediately after fill. Initial stop ~$569.70 (10% below $633).

**Thesis:** Meta's AI-driven advertising moat (+19% impression growth, +12% pricing) creates compounding
FCF at scale. The subscription launch ($3.99/month across Instagram/Facebook) layers recurring revenue
atop the ad business. Llama open-source creates an enterprise AI ecosystem. 64-analyst "Strong Buy"
consensus with $826.75 target (31% upside) on reasonable valuation (PEG 0.64). The AI capex
overhang ($125-145B) is known and priced — META's ad machine generates enough FCF to fund it.
Invalidation: advertising market deterioration (ad pricing falls >10% YoY, impressions stall);
Llama open-source strategy reversal; META breaks below $570 on volume.

### Planned trades for today (Monday June 1, 2026)

**1 new position: BUY META 15 shares** (carried slot from last week)

**BUY META 15 shares** (limit order ~0.3% below opening quote per lessons.md)
*Thesis:* Meta's AI-driven advertising moat is compounding revenue at +33% YoY with ad impressions
+19% and pricing +12%. The May 27 subscription launch (Instagram Plus/Facebook Plus, $3.99/month)
adds a recurring revenue layer. Llama open-source flywheel drives enterprise AI ecosystem adoption.
64 analysts Strong Buy, avg target $826.75 (31% upside), PEG 0.64 on 30%+ growth. Constructive
macro, AI sentiment at cycle highs (NVDA Computex, MSFT Build), enterprise AI demand confirmed by
Snowflake Q1. Starting at 9.3% of portfolio — room to scale.
*Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
*Invalidation:* Break below $570 on volume; advertising market deterioration; META capex ROI concerns escalate.

**No action on:**
- AVGO: DO NOT ADD — earnings June 3 (2 days). Hold stop. Expect strong print; evaluate scale-up post-earnings.
- LLY: HOLD — CVS catalyst live but priced in; stock soft −0.63%. Wait for momentum to rebuild.
- All other positions: HOLD with trailing stops. MSFT and AVGO stops will auto-ratchet at open.

**Upcoming catalysts this week:**
- MSFT Build conference June 2–3 — new AI coding model reveal. Positive for MSFT thesis.
- AVGO earnings June 3 (after close) — KEY EVENT. If strong beat + AI revenue raised → scale AVGO to 12-15%.
- NVDA ex-dividend June 4 — $0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 credit.
- LLY: CVS Foundayo coverage effective today. Monitor for any secondary price response.

## 2026-05-29 — Pre-market research (~08:00 ET)

**Today is Friday May 29. Weekly new-position count: 2/3 used (NVDA + LLY on May 26). 1 slot remaining — decision TODAY.**

### Macro

- **Core PCE (April 2026, released 8:30 AM ET today):** +0.2% MoM, +3.3% YoY.
  - Monthly 0.2% is BELOW our 0.35% threshold → **NO stop tightening on NVDA/AVGO needed.**
  - Annual 3.3% in line with estimates. The soft monthly reading suggests the prior inflation bump
    is beginning to ease — constructive for AI multiples and rate outlook.
  - 10yr yield watch threshold 4.75% unchanged.
- **Iran deal:** US and Iran reached a tentative agreement for Strait of Hormuz reopening and
  nuclear talks. WTI oil falling to ~$87.66/bbl (−1.4%), Brent ~$92.47 (−1.3%). Very positive macro
  relief — eases energy-driven inflation pressure. Deal not yet finalized but trajectory clearly positive.
- **S&P 500 futures:** +0.1% pre-market. Flat but constructive; market digesting benign PCE and
  Iran deal news. No risk-off signal.
- **Market posture:** Constructive heading into the open. PCE benign, oil falling, Iran optimism.
  No defensive pivot warranted. Broad market risk-on bias into end of week.

### COST Earnings decision — SKIP

**COST Q3 2026 results (reported May 28 after close):**
- EPS: $4.93 (barely beat consensus $4.92 — 0.2% surprise; well below our $5.10 strong-beat threshold)
- Net sales: $69.15B (+11.6% YoY); total revenue $70.53B (beat consensus ~$69.64B but missed our $71B threshold)
- Worldwide membership renewal: 89.7% (missed our >90% threshold; US/Canada 92.2% ✓)
- Comparable same-store sales: +9.8% (+6.6% ex-FX/gas) — operationally solid
- E-commerce comps: +21.5% — strong digital growth
- After-hours reaction: "After-Hours Share Price Rises Only Slightly"
- **Decision: SKIP COST.** Pre-stated strong-beat criteria NOT met:
  - EPS $4.93 vs $5.10 threshold (essentially in-line with consensus, not a "beat and raise")
  - Revenue $70.53B vs $71B threshold (missed)
  - Worldwide renewal 89.7% vs >90% threshold (missed by 30 bps)
  - AH reaction confirms market wasn't impressed — lukewarm print, not a catalyst print
- **Final weekly slot CARRIED to week of June 1.** No forcing.

### Held position updates (pre-market May 29)

**AVGO ($433.50 pre-mkt, +1.62% vs prior close $426.58, entry $417.37 = +3.87% overall):**
- Pre-market strength ahead of the week's close. No company-specific catalyst today.
- Analyst upgrades: Susquehanna raised target $450→$490; Citi raised target to $500 (Buy).
- 26 analysts Buy, 4 Hold consensus.
- **AVGO earnings June 3 — DO NOT ADD.** Hold with trailing stop. HWM $435.31, stop $391.78.
  If AVGO clears $435.31 intraday today, broker will ratchet the stop.

**MSFT ($434.00 pre-mkt, +1.64% vs prior close $426.99, entry $422.31 = +2.77% overall):**
- **ABOVE trailing stop HWM $429.49.** Broker will ratchet HWM and stop higher at open.
  New HWM will be ~$434.00+; new stop will be ~$390.60+.
- Azure AI thesis intact. No new negative catalysts.
- Three consecutive sessions of strong recovery (+3.21% Wed, +3.05% Thu, +1.64% pre-mkt Fri).

**AMZN ($271.70 pre-mkt, −0.84% vs prior close $274.00, entry $269.13 = +0.96% overall):**
- Minor pullback after recent highs. HWM ratcheted to $274.37 (from $273.93) during May 28 session.
  Stop now $246.93. Thesis intact. AWS backlog + Anthropic thesis unchanged.

**LLY ($1,122.05 pre-mkt, −0.42% vs prior close $1,126.80, entry $1,072.94 = +4.58% overall):**
- Minor pullback but **KEY NEW CATALYST confirmed:**
  - **CVS announced it will restore Zepbound coverage AND add Foundayo (once-daily GLP-1 pill)
    to its standard drug plans, effective June 1 (Foundayo) and October 1 (Zepbound).** This is
    a major commercial access win — CVS Caremark is one of the largest PBM networks in the US.
    Broader formulary access = higher adoption, higher revenue.
  - Also: LLY in discussions for ~$4B in vaccine deals (Curevo, LimmaTech) — pipeline diversification.
  - GLP-1 market share: 60.1% US obesity market (Novo Nordisk 39.4%). Lead is growing.
- HWM $1,149.10, stop $1,034.19. Thesis STRONGEST in the portfolio. Hold.

**NVDA ($214.82 pre-mkt, +0.27% vs prior close $214.25, entry $216.30 = −0.69% overall):**
- Stable consolidation. No new catalysts. AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact.
- Ex-dividend June 4 ($0.25/sh). HWM $218.18, stop $196.36.

### Planned trades for today (Friday May 29, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

COST earnings did not meet the strong-beat criteria (EPS $4.93 vs $5.10 threshold; revenue $70.53B vs $71B threshold; worldwide renewal 89.7% vs >90% threshold). AH reaction minimal — market confirmed the print was uninspiring. Do not buy COST.

PCE benign (0.2% MoM) means no stop tightening and no defensive pivot. Iran deal constructive. Portfolio intact.

**Final weekly position slot (1 of 3) carried to week of June 1.** Candidates for that week:
- **META** (ad-tech AI flywheel, strong FCF, ~$607+) — if week of June 1 opens constructively
- **LLY scale-up** — if LLY thesis continues to strengthen post-CVS coverage; could scale toward 10-12%
- **New name research** — with AVGO earnings June 3, best to wait until after the print before concentrating further in AI semis

**Calendar reminders:**
- AVGO earnings June 3 — DO NOT add. Hold stop. If strong beat → evaluate scale-up to 12-15%.
- NVDA ex-dividend June 4 ($0.25/sh × 30sh = $7.50 dividend credit)
- LLY CVS Foundayo coverage effective June 1
- Weekly review routine later today (4:30 PM ET) — self-grade the week

## 2026-05-28 — Pre-market research (~08:10 ET)

**Today is Thursday May 28. Weekly new-position count: 2/3 used (NVDA + LLY on May 26). 1 slot remaining.**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 / SPY:** SPY closed $750.59 on May 27 (+0.04% vs May 26 close $750.31). Pre-market
  futures down ~0.2% as oil ticks up on new Iran strikes. Mild risk-off heading into PCE tomorrow.
  SPY pre-market bid/ask ~$748.95–$749.07.
- **WTI Oil:** ~$90/bbl (+1.8% today). New US military strikes on Iranian military site reported
  overnight. WTI rose from ~$88 area. Still well below $100 watch trigger; geopolitical noise
  but trajectory remains constructive (deal framework still in progress, Strait of Hormuz
  negotiations ongoing). No change to macro stance.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** ~4.48–4.50% (well below 4.75% watch level — constructive for AI
  multiples). Treasury yields tick lower as investors remain optimistic on Iran peace deal
  despite fresh strikes.
- **Key events today / this week:**
  - **LLY Bernstein conference TODAY 1:30 PM ET** — CSO Skovronsky fireside chat. Potential
    positive catalyst for LLY.
  - **COST earnings TONIGHT after close** — Q3 2026 EPS consensus $4.92, revenue $69.64B.
    Consumer defensive candidate for final weekly slot.
  - **Core PCE TOMORROW Fri May 29** — critical Fed watch. If >0.35% MoM, tighten stops on
    NVDA/AVGO and skip final weekly slot this week.
- **Market posture:** Cautious but not bearish. PCE tomorrow is the dominant event. Mild
  headwinds today; no defensive pivot needed. Hold all positions.

### MRVL decision — SKIP

**MRVL Q1 FY2027 results (reported May 27 after close):**
- Revenue: $2.418B (+28% YoY); beat consensus $2.41B — barely above
- Non-GAAP EPS: $0.80; beat consensus $0.75 — solid but not spectacular
- Data center: $1.833B (+27% YoY) — 76% of revenue, confirming AI tailwind
- Q2 guidance: $2.700B ± 5% (~$2.57–$2.84B), non-GAAP EPS $0.93
- **Price action:** Stock closed regular session May 27 at $198.69 (down from $208.22 prior close
  as the market sold into the print). After-hours popped to ~$215.70 on the beat, but today
  pre-market is fading to ~$200 — effectively erasing the entire AH gain.
- **Decision: SKIP MRVL.** My stated entry criteria required strong beat: EPS >$0.85 (got $0.80)
  and revenue >$2.5B (got $2.418B). Neither threshold met. Q2 guide is genuinely strong ($2.70B
  = +12% sequential) but the stock tells the truth: market expected more. A pre-market fade from
  $215 to $200 on a strong guide means the stock was priced for perfection. Don't chase into a
  rug-pull pattern.

### Held position updates

**AVGO ($421.81 close May 27, +1.06% from entry $417.37):**
- Session was volatile (range $416–$432). Closed constructively.
- AH: $423.42 — stable above close.
- Thesis intact. **DO NOT ADD — earnings June 3 (4 trading days).** Hold with stop.
- Stop: HWM $435.31, stop $391.78.

**MSFT ($412.71 close May 27, -2.27% from entry $422.31):**
- Continues soft. AH: $413.61. No new negative news. Azure AI thesis intact.
- Ackman/Pershing Square bullish signal intact. -2.27% well above -7% cut threshold.
- Stop: HWM $424.40, stop $381.96.

**AMZN ($271.85 close May 27, +1.01% from entry $269.13):**
- Strong session (+2.31% yesterday). Pre-market today: $271.46 — holding gains.
- AWS $364B backlog + $100B Anthropic thesis unchanged. BofA maintained Buy, $310 target.
- Stop: HWM $272.41, stop $245.17. May ratchet further today if session is positive.

**LLY ($1,084.23 close May 27, +1.05% from entry $1,072.94):**
- Strong +1.64% session yesterday. Bernstein conference TODAY 1:30 PM ET with CSO Skovronsky.
- Likely to discuss retatrutide TRIUMPH-1 data and Foundayo. Expect positive commentary.
- Thesis strongly intact. Stop: HWM $1,093.00, stop $983.70.

**NVDA ($212.58 close May 27, -1.72% from entry $216.30):**
- Softest name. MRVL earnings had negligible read-through negative (NVDA steady ~$212 AH).
- AI accelerator thesis unchanged. Ex-div June 4 ($0.25/sh).
- Stop: HWM $218.18, stop $196.36. Current is $16.54 above stop — safe.

### Planned trades for today (Thursday May 28, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

MRVL skip confirmed (see above). Mild risk-off pre-market + PCE tomorrow = wrong day to
force the final weekly slot.

**Final slot decision — Friday morning:**
- Monitor COST earnings tonight after close:
  - If strong beat (EPS >$5.10, revenue >$71B) + membership renewal >90% + positive guidance →
    consider COST 15 shares at Friday's open (~$930/sh est. = ~$13,950, ~14% of portfolio —
    exceeds daily 25% cap only if combined with other buys, so this would be fine as standalone).
    Actually: COST 15sh × ~$930 = ~$13,950 = ~14% of portfolio, well within caps.
    Thesis: Consumer defensive diversification; membership-loyalty recession resilience; AI
    supply-chain efficiency moat; 15% EPS growth. Adds sector balance to AI-heavy book.
  - If miss or cautious → skip COST. Evaluate META (ad-tech AI flywheel, strong FCF) or carry
    final slot to week of June 1.
- Core PCE tomorrow: if >0.35% MoM, skip final slot this week entirely regardless of COST.
- Target: 3 positions/week cap used only if both prints are constructive. No forcing.

**Calendar reminders:**
- LLY Bernstein conference TODAY 1:30 PM ET — monitor.
- COST earnings tonight.
- Core PCE tomorrow 8:30 AM ET.
- AVGO earnings June 3 — DO NOT add before results.

## 2026-05-27 — Pre-market research (~08:10 ET)

**Today is Wednesday May 27. Weekly new-position count: 2/3 used (NVDA + LLY on May 26). 1 slot remaining.**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 / SPY:** SPY closed $750.46 on May 26 (+0.64% from May 22 close $745.67). Pre-market
  quotes: bid $751.48 / ask $751.58. S&P 500 futures up +0.37% pre-market.
  **Goldman Sachs raised S&P 500 year-end target to 8,000 today** (from 7,600), citing 24% EPS
  growth in 2026 driven by AI momentum. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank similarly bullish.
  Market at/near all-time highs — constructive.
- **WTI Oil:** ~$93-94/bbl. Still below our $100 watch trigger. Iran ceasefire extension framework
  in negotiation (60-day extension, Strait of Hormuz reopening). Sides remain at odds over
  enriched uranium stockpile and transit tolls. Deal not signed but trajectory positive. Oil
  decline continues to be the dominant macro positive vs. last week.
- **10yr Treasury yield:** Last known ~4.595% (May 22 close). Below 4.75% watch level — no change.
- **Key events this week:**
  - **MRVL earnings tonight after close** — Q1 FY2027 EPS $0.79, revenue $2.41B expected.
    Third position candidate if they beat.
  - **LLY Bernstein conference tomorrow Thu May 28** — fireside chat 1:30 PM ET with CSO Skovronsky.
  - **Core PCE + GDP Q1 revision Fri May 29** — **CORRECTION from prior log: it is Friday May 29,
    not Thursday May 28.** Critical for Fed outlook; if >0.35% MoM, tighten stops on AI names.
- **Market posture:** Decidedly risk-on. Goldman target raise + AI sentiment strong + WTI contained.
  No defensive posture needed today.

### Held position updates

**AVGO ($427.80 pre-mkt, +1.37% today vs $422.01 close, entry $417.37 = +2.50% overall):**
- Strong pre-market move. New catalyst: launched industry's first 50G PON Gateway Chip with
  built-in AI — incremental positive confirming continued product leadership.
- Evercore ISI reiterated Outperform, target $582. Citi named AVGO top semi pick for 2026.
- **AVGO earnings June 3 — DO NOT ADD. Hold with trailing stop (HWM $435.31, stop $391.78).**

**MSFT ($412.51 pre-mkt, -0.85% today vs $416.03 close, entry $422.31 = -2.32% overall):**
- Mild softness pre-market; no company-specific negative news.
- **Bullish signal:** Ackman/Pershing Square disclosed significant MSFT position — a notable
  high-conviction value endorsement from a major fund.
- Strong Buy consensus (55 analysts), avg target $560.63 (+36% upside). Azure AI >40% growing.
- -2.32% from entry; well above -7% cut threshold. Stop HWM $424.40, stop $381.96. Thesis intact.

**AMZN ($264.01 pre-mkt, -0.48% today vs $265.29 close, entry $269.13 = -1.90% overall):**
- Minor softness continues. No new catalysts. AWS $364B backlog / $100B Anthropic thesis unchanged.
- Well above -7% threshold. Stop HWM $269.79, stop $242.81. Thesis intact.

**NVDA ($215.22 pre-mkt, +0.17% today, entry $216.30 = -0.50% overall):**
- Essentially flat, consolidating post-entry. MRVL earnings tonight are an AI read-through.
- Ex-dividend June 4 ($0.25/sh). AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact.
- Stop HWM $218.18, stop $196.36. No action.

**LLY ($1,066.60 pre-mkt, +0.18% today, entry $1,072.94 = -0.59% overall):**
- **THESIS SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENED:**
  - Retatrutide TRIUMPH-1 Phase 3: ALL doses (4mg/9mg/12mg) met primary and key secondary
    endpoints at 80 weeks. This is the pivotal trial that confirms retatrutide as the
    definitive next-gen GLP-1 — extraordinary result.
  - FDA approved Foundayo (once-daily oral GLP-1 pill, no food/water restrictions) —
    broadens Lilly's commercial reach and removes a key patient adherence barrier.
  - Foundayo/Zepbound weight maintenance data announced May 12 also positive.
- Wall Street firms turning increasingly bullish on GLP-1 expansion plans.
- **Bernstein conference tomorrow (May 28, 1:30 PM ET)** — CSO Skovronsky fireside chat.
  Likely to discuss TRIUMPH-1 and Foundayo — potential positive catalyst.
- -0.59% from entry is purely noise given the fundamental confirmation. Hold.
  Stop HWM $1,081.94, stop $973.75.

### MRVL — Third position candidate (earnings tonight)

- **Q1 FY2027 earnings after market close tonight (May 27).**
- Consensus: EPS $0.79 (+27% YoY), revenue $2.41B (+26% YoY). FY2026 full-year revenue was
  $8.195B (+42% YoY) — very strong baseline.
- AI custom silicon story: hyperscalers accelerating custom ASIC orders. Management sees >20%
  custom revenue growth YoY in FY2027, doubling in FY2028, >$2B NIC/CXL revenue by FY2029.
- HSBC upgraded to Buy with $300 target (from $85) yesterday — massive target raise signals
  catch-up upgrades on AI custom silicon story just being understood.
- **Pre-market TODAY down 5.32% to $206.77** (from prior close ~$217.21). Likely institutional
  profit-taking ahead of a volatile print (stock doubled in 2026); not a thesis break.
- Citi target $215, BofA/RBC/Oppenheimer ~$200-210. Wide range reflects uncertainty on timing.
- **Plan:** DO NOT buy before the print. If Q1 beats strongly AND Q2 guidance impresses:
  - Entry signal: MRVL as 3rd position tomorrow morning, 30 shares (~$6,200 at ~$207, ~6.2% of
    portfolio). Within all guardrails (1 slot remaining, daily cap ample).
  - Thesis: AI custom silicon secular wave corroborated by AVGO; MRVL plays the same tailwind
    with network connectivity and storage; hyperscaler ASIC diversification is a real trend.
  - Stop: 10% trailing immediately after fill.
  - Risk: pre-earnings pops are sold; if they miss, stock drops 15-20%+. Wait for the print.
- If MRVL MISSES or guides down: skip for this week. Evaluate META or COST for the final slot.

### Planned trades for today (Wednesday May 27, 2026)

**No trades planned.**

All five positions are intact and well above guardrail thresholds. MRVL earnings after close
tonight are the gating event for this week's third position slot. Waiting for the print before
committing capital.

**Third position decision (this week's final slot):**
- If MRVL beats Q1 + strong Q2 guidance → BUY MRVL 30 shares at tomorrow's open (limit ~0.3%
  below opening quote). Thesis: AI custom silicon/networking, corroborates AVGO thesis.
- If MRVL misses or cautious guide → Skip MRVL. Consider META (ad-tech AI flywheel) or COST
  (defensive, reports earnings tomorrow May 28) as alternatives for the week's final slot.

**Calendar corrections:**
- **Core PCE is Friday May 29, not Thursday May 28** — updated across memory.
- AVGO earnings June 3 — DO NOT ADD before. Trailing stop in place.
- LLY Bernstein conference Thu May 28 (tomorrow) — monitor for positive commentary.

## 2026-05-26 — Pre-market research (~08:05 ET)

**Today is Tuesday May 26 — first trading day after Memorial Day. Weekly new-position cap resets this week.**

### Macro

- **S&P 500 / SPY:** Futures up +0.54% pre-market. SPY pre-market bid/ask ~$750.68 (last close $745.67 on May 22). Well above our $738 floor for executing today's plan. Market is at all-time highs — constructive.
- **OIL — MAJOR RELIEF:** WTI crude fell ~6% on Monday to ~$92/bbl (was $105.42 at last week's close). Brent also down ~5-6%. Catalyst: Trump announced Monday that Iran talks "proceeding nicely" and an MOU is "close to finalization." The draft deal (per Axios/CNN May 24 reports) includes a 60-day ceasefire, Strait of Hormuz reopening, Iran allowed to freely sell oil, and nuclear enrichment negotiations. **This is the dominant macro positive today.** WTI at $92 is well below our $110 trigger level. NOTE: Washington also launched fresh strikes on Iranian vessels Monday, creating residual uncertainty — deal is close but not signed.
- **Key data this week:** Consumer Confidence (today, Tues May 26); Core PCE + GDP Q1 revision (Thu May 28 — critical); earnings from Marvell (MRVL), Salesforce (CRM), Snowflake (SNOW) on Wed May 27; Dell (DELL), Costco (COST), Best Buy (BBY) on Thu May 28; Synopsys (SNPS) also reports.
- **Market posture:** Decidedly risk-on at open. Iran deal optimism + oil collapse + market at ATH = strong setup for deploying the two planned positions. Iran deal is not finalized (watch for breakdown risk), but risk/reward has improved materially from Friday.

### Held position updates

**AVGO ($417.08 pre-market, entry $417.37):**
- Pre-market up +0.71% intraday vs. May 22 close of $414.14 → effectively recovering to near entry.
- **Earnings June 3 (6 trading days away, after close):** Major near-term catalyst. Analyst estimates: Q2 FY2026 revenue $22.08B (vs $15B a year ago = +47% YoY); EPS normalized ~$2.39 (vs $1.58 = +51% YoY). Broadcom's own guidance implies ~47% growth.
- LSEG renewed Broadcom cloud infrastructure partnership (minor positive).
- **Action: HOLD with trailing stop (HWM $419.75, stop ~$377.78). Do NOT add to AVGO within 5 trading days of June 3 earnings.** Thesis remains strongly intact.

**MSFT ($419.30 pre-market, entry $422.31):**
- Predicted open ~$420.50 (+0.46%). Pre-market quote ~$419-420.
- New: Microsoft restructured OpenAI deal — ends revenue-share arrangement, secures OpenAI IP through 2032, allows OpenAI to use any cloud. Mixed: loses OpenAI exclusivity, but Wedbush raised target to $575 and pegs ~$6B from OpenAI in 2026. Net neutral to slightly positive — Azure AI moat is independent of OpenAI exclusivity.
- **Action: HOLD with trailing stop (HWM $424.40, stop ~$381.96). Thesis intact.**

**AMZN ($267.46 pre-market, entry $269.13):**
- Up +0.43% intraday vs. May 22 close of $266.32.
- Jefferies added AMZN to Franchise Picks list (May 18 — confirms broad buy consensus). AWS $364B backlog + $100B Anthropic commitment thesis unchanged.
- **Action: HOLD with trailing stop (HWM $269.785, stop ~$242.81). Thesis intact.**

### Watchlist / new candidates

| Ticker | Pre-market | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| NVDA | ~$215-217 (est. open $217.17) | **ENTRY SIGNAL — PROCEED.** Last close $215.34 (May 22). Expected open ~$217. China market expansion ($200B processor market) is a new incremental catalyst. Q1 +85%, Q2 guide $91B, $80B buyback. Ex-div June 4 ($0.25). 61 analysts Strong Buy, avg target $295.34 (+36.6%). Entry condition met: below $220 target, contracting volume on prior session. |
| LLY | ~$1,065-1,070 (est. near Friday close) | **ENTRY SIGNAL — PROCEED.** Last close $1,065.60 (May 22). New catalyst Monday: Verve-102 Phase 1b gene-editing cholesterol data released late Monday (permanent LDL reduction with single infusion — diversifies beyond GLP-1 franchise). Retatrutide data (70lb/18mo weight loss) still driving upgrades. Bernstein conference Thu May 28 (potential further catalyst). Up 14% in May; RSI 68.3 (near overbought — use limit order to avoid chasing at open). Forward P/E 28x (elevated but supported by growth). |
| META | ~$607 | Hold on watchlist. 3rd position slot if week develops well. No urgent entry today. |
| XOM | ~$145-150 (est.) | With WTI falling to $92 on Iran deal optimism, XOM upside thesis is diminished near-term. Remove from urgent watchlist; revisit post-deal confirmation for any overshooting energy selloff. |
| MRVL | Earnings Wed May 27 | AI networking angle (Broadcom competitor for hyperscaler custom ASICs). If they beat on AI data-center revenue, could be a new candidate for 3rd position slot. Watch earnings reaction Wed evening. |
| COST | Earnings Thu May 28 | Consumer defensive with strong membership model. Watch earnings for 3rd position slot if macros stabilize post-PCE. |

### Planned trades for Tuesday May 26, 2026 market open

**Two new starter positions — total deployment ~$13,920 (~13.9% of portfolio; within 25% daily cap).**
**Weekly new-position count after fills: 2 of 3.** One slot remains for later this week.

1. **BUY NVDA 30 shares** (limit order ~0.3% below opening quote — approx $216.35 if opens at $217)
   *Thesis:* AI accelerator monopoly with no credible near-term competitor; Q1 FY27 revenue $81.6B (+85% YoY), Q2 guidance $91B (continued acceleration); $80B buyback + dividend increase; China market expansion ($200B target market) is new incremental catalyst; ex-dividend June 4 ($0.25/share, minor); 61 analyst Strong Buy consensus, avg target $295 (+36.6% upside). Entry below $220 on contracting volume — bullish consolidation signal. Not chasing.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* Closes below $195 on volume; any major hyperscaler announces material capex cuts; single-customer concentration risk materializes.

2. **BUY LLY 7 shares** (limit order ~0.3% below opening quote — approx $1,062 if opens at $1,065)
   *Thesis:* GLP-1 secular dominance (retatrutide 70lb/18mo trial); new Monday catalyst: Verve-102 Phase 1b gene-editing cholesterol data broadens Lilly's pipeline beyond obesity; Q1 revenue +56% YoY, guidance raised; Bernstein conference May 28 (potential upgrade wave); healthcare adds diversification vs. concentrated AI tech exposure; 31 analysts Strong Buy, consensus ~13% upside.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* Retatrutide FDA setback or unexpected safety signal; competitor takes material GLP-1 market share; breaks below $960 on volume.

**Execution guidance:**
- Place limit orders ~0.3% below the opening quote for each name (per lesson from May 22 opening-minute fills).
- Contingency — do NOT trade if: SPY opens DOWN >1% from Friday close (<$738) OR WTI spikes above $110 at open. Both conditions are currently very favorable (SPY pre-mkt +0.54%, WTI $92) so conditions are met — expect to trade at open.
- After fills, verify positions and orders. Place 10% trailing stops immediately.

**Third position (later this week):** MRVL (watch May 27 earnings — AI networking angle) or META (ad-tech flywheel, reserve). XOM removed from near-term list given oil decline. COST could be a post-PCE defensive entry Thu/Fri. No urgency — do not force.

**AVGO earnings watch (June 3):** Do NOT add to AVGO until post-earnings. Current trailing stop intact. Thesis is the strongest in the portfolio heading into what should be a strong Q2 print. If earnings beat strongly, consider scaling AVGO up to 12-15% in subsequent session.

## 2026-05-25 — Pre-market research (~08:15 ET; Memorial Day — planning for Tuesday May 26 open)

**Market closed today (Memorial Day).** Next open: Tuesday May 26, 9:30 AM ET.
Weekly new-position cap resets this week (May 26–30). Trailing stops all verified active.

### Macro

- **S&P 500:** Closed at 8th consecutive weekly gain; SPY closed $745.67 (+0.37% vs prior close,
  +0.84% from our inception $739.44). Dow set new record high (+294 pts May 22). Market at ATH —
  constructive. S&P 500 index above 7,500.
- **Treasury yields (May 22 close):** 10yr ~4.595% (EASED from 4.67%, now below our 4.75% watch
  level — a modest positive for AI multiples). 30yr ~5.127% (highest since 2007, still a risk).
- **OIL — MAJOR ESCALATION:** WTI surged +4.2% to $105.42/bbl on Friday May 22 (was ~$96 earlier
  in the week). US-Iran deal stalled again. Brent near $113/bbl. Average US gas >$4.50/gal (+51%
  since Iran war start). This is the dominant macro risk and inflation driver.
- **Consumer sentiment:** UMich survey fell to new low in May. Consumers worried about gas prices
  and inflation — stagflation risk remains real. Watch for PCE Thursday to confirm or ease concern.
- **Week ahead (May 26–30):** Consumer Confidence (Tues May 26); Core PCE + GDP Q1 second
  estimate (Thu May 28 — critical for Fed outlook). Key earnings: Marvell (MRVL), Salesforce
  (CRM), Snowflake (SNOW) on Wed May 27; Dell (DELL), Costco (COST), Best Buy (BBY) on Thu May 28.
  Synopsys (SNPS) reports — watch for AI EDA cycle signal.
- **Market posture:** Constructive at ATH, with AI trade dominant. Market is looking through
  Iran/oil shock for now. PCE Thursday is the week's pivotal risk event. Oil at $105 is the
  primary tail risk — any further escalation above $110 warrants adding caution.

### Held position updates (weekend news through May 25)

**AVGO ($414.01 close May 22):** Strong Buy consensus (26 analysts); Q1 custom AI chip sales
+140% YoY; data-center networking revenue +60% YoY. New: joined a $125M "Semiconductor Hub"
at UCLA with Meta, Applied Materials, GlobalFoundries, Synopsys — deepens AI ecosystem
integration and signals durable hyperscaler partnership expansion. Evercore target $582 (raised
May 19). Thesis strongly intact. 10% trailing stop active, HWM $419.75, stop $377.78. No action.

**MSFT ($418.50 close May 22):** Q3 FY2026 revenue $82.9B (+18% YoY); Azure AI +40%;
55-analyst consensus "Strong Buy," avg target $560.63; RBC $640 target. Worst-performing
Mag-7 YTD (−13%) — improving entry vs. quality. Negatives: Gates Foundation exited (minor),
LinkedIn 600 layoffs (minor), Activision $250M settlement (manageable). Ackman bullish.
Thesis intact. Trailing stop active, HWM $424.40, stop $381.96. No action.

**AMZN ($266.27 close May 22):** AWS backlog has grown to $364B (vs $244B in prior research) +
new $100B Anthropic commitment (major new catalyst — reinforces AWS as the dominant AI cloud
platform). AWS Q1 operating income $14.2B = 59% of total company earnings. Market cap
approaching $3T. Stock +24% since early April on AI momentum. Thesis significantly strengthened.
Trailing stop active, HWM $269.785, stop $242.81. No action.

### Watchlist / new candidates

| Ticker | Close May 22 | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| NVDA | $215.34 | **ENTRY SIGNAL MET.** Closed below $220 on contracting volume (4.84M vs 6.22M prior session). 8.7% below ATH $235.74 (May 14). Bull flag consolidating post-earnings. Q1 +85% YoY, Q2 guide $91B, $80B buyback + dividend increase. AI accelerator monopoly intact. |
| LLY | $1,065.60 | **ENTRY SIGNAL MET.** Retatrutide (next-gen GLP-1) showed 70lb avg weight loss in 80-week trial — extraordinary obesity data. Q1 revenue +56% YoY, guidance raised $2B. Bernstein conference May 28 (potential near-term catalyst). Moved +2.3% on May 22 on trial data. 7sh = ~$7,460 (7.5% of portfolio). |
| META | ~$607 | Q1 revenue $56.3B (+33% YoY). Strong FCF. $125–145B capex raised — overhang. Not urgent this week. |
| XOM | ~$154 | Oil at $105 supportive but no fresh company catalyst. Watchlist; monitor for Iran resolution or further escalation. |

### Planned trades for Tuesday May 26, 2026 market open

**Two new starter positions — total deployment ~$13,920 (~13.9% of portfolio; within 25% daily cap).**
**Weekly new-position count after fills: 2 of 3** (one remaining for later this week).

1. **BUY NVDA 30 shares** (est. ~$6,460 at ~$215–217)
   *Thesis:* AI accelerator monopoly with no credible near-term competitor; Q1 FY27 revenue
   $81.6B (+85% YoY), Q2 guidance $91B (continued acceleration); $80B buyback + dividend increase
   signals confidence; entry criterion met — closed $215.34, below our $220 target, on contracting
   volume (4.84M vs 6.22M prior session); bull flag forming off ATH $235.74 (8.7% pullback).
   Not chasing — consolidating at support. 6.5% starter position.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* Closes below $195 on volume (flag base violated); any hyperscaler announces
   material capex cuts; single-customer concentration risk emerges.

2. **BUY LLY 7 shares** (est. ~$7,460 at ~$1,065–1,070)
   *Thesis:* Secular GLP-1 dominance in obesity/diabetes; major new catalyst — retatrutide trial
   showed 70lb average weight loss at 80 weeks, among the strongest obesity drug data ever
   published; Q1 revenue +56% YoY, guidance raised $2B; Bernstein conference May 28 (potential
   positive catalyst this week); healthcare sector adds portfolio diversification vs. concentrated
   AI tech exposure. 7 shares at ~$1,065 = ~7.5% starter.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* Retatrutide FDA setback or unexpected safety signal; new GLP-1 competitor
   takes material market share; breaks below $960 on volume.

**Execution guidance (applying May 22 lesson):**
- Place limit orders ~0.3% below the opening quote for each name.
- If SPY opens DOWN >1% from Friday close (<~$738): hold both, do not trade.
- If WTI crude opens above $110 at 9:30 AM: reduce NVDA to 20sh, keep LLY unchanged
  (healthcare is less sensitive to oil than high-multiple AI names).
- PCE Thursday (May 28): if it prints hot (>0.35% MoM), tighten trailing stops on AVGO and NVDA.

**Third position (later this week):** Hold in reserve. Consider META if AI-driven ad-tech thesis
strengthens or XOM if oil/Iran dynamics present a clear catalyst. No urgency — do not force.

---

## 2026-05-22 — Pre-market research (~08:10 ET)

### Macro

- **SPY pre-market:** $744.52 (+0.24% from yesterday's close $742.71; +0.69% from inception $739.44).
  S&P 500 closed May 21 at 7,445.72 (+0.17%). Dow at record 50,285.66 (+0.55%). Nasdaq +0.09%.
- **Treasury yields — key risk:** 10-year yield at 4.67% (highest in over a year); 30-year yield at
  5.2%, a 19-year high. Elevated yields driven by Iran war inflation fears. This is the primary
  multiple-compression headwind for high-P/E growth names.
- **Iran:** Trump administration says "final stages" of negotiations; Supreme Leader directive to
  keep enriched uranium domestically complicates deal. Oil remains very elevated: WTI $96.35/bbl,
  Brent $102.58/bbl. Strait of Hormuz effectively still closed; food prices and airfares rising.
- **AI sentiment:** Nvidia earnings powered a massive AI momentum boost — SoftBank +11% pre-market
  Thursday, AI-linked stocks broadly bid. This is a tailwind for our three planned positions.
- **Economic calendar today:** University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment (final May) — watch for
  1-year inflation expectations, which the Fed monitors for de-anchoring risk.
- **Market posture:** Constructive — S&P at highs, AI trade very strong, momentum intact. The 10yr
  at 4.67% and 30yr at 5.2% are genuine risks that could compress multiples on high-P/E names,
  but the market is currently accepting these yields. Holding 75% cash post-fills gives us
  optionality if yields cause a correction.

### Held positions

None — 100% cash.

### Watchlist / candidate review

| Ticker | Last close | Pre-mkt | Notes |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| AVGO | $414.32 | ~$414 | Wells Fargo raised target $430→$545 (May 14); Evercore raised $490→$582 (May 19). AI chip revenue running 30–40% above prior estimates. New Meta partnership on 2nm AI chip. Trading 39x forward — elevated but supported by growth. Thesis very intact. |
| MSFT | $419.00 | ~$420 | Q3 FY2026: EPS $4.27 beat (non-GAAP $4.14 another quarter's cut); Azure +40%; AI revenue accelerating. EY $1B+ alliance for enterprise AI. Analyst consensus target $587 — 40% upside. Thesis intact. |
| AMZN | $268.50 | ~$268 | Q1 2026: Revenue $181.5B (+17% YoY), AWS $37.6B (+28% YoY, fastest in 15 qtrs). AI chip (Trainium) gaining traction. 57/60 analysts buy. Wells Fargo target $312 (+16% upside). Near $3T market cap milestone. Thesis intact. |
| NVDA | ~$221 | — | Blowout Q1 FY2027 (reported May 20): Revenue $81.62B (+85% YoY), Q2 guidance $91B. AI momentum driver. Not in this week's plan — monitor for future entry on any pullback. |
| SPY | $742.71 | $744.52 | S&P benchmark. +0.69% since inception. |

### Thesis confirmations for today's plan

**AVGO:** AI custom silicon / ASIC leadership confirmed. Two major sell-side upgrades this week.
Meta 2nm chip partnership is a new concrete catalyst. Edge: analyst targets ($545–$582) vs. current
price (~$414) imply 32–41% upside on 28-analyst Strong Buy consensus. Not technically extended —
trading near the middle of its recent range. Treasury yield risk noted but AVGO's revenue growth
story (30–40% above prior estimates) provides fundamental buffer against multiple compression.

**MSFT:** Azure AI +40% growth at scale is the defining data point. Enterprise install-base moat
means AI revenue has nowhere to go but up as Copilot seats compound. Down ~12% YTD from peak
provides an improving entry vs. quality. Consensus target of $587 implies ~40% upside. The EY
$1B+ alliance is the kind of enterprise AI deal that repeats across every sector.

**AMZN:** AWS acceleration (+28% YoY, fastest in 15 quarters) is the clearest signal that AI
cloud demand is accelerating, not slowing. $244B committed backlog growing 40% YoY makes revenue
visibility exceptional. Near the $3T milestone with 57/60 analyst buys — broad conviction.

---

### Planned trades for today (Friday May 22, 2026 market open)

**Three starter positions — total deployment ~$24,700 (~24.7% of portfolio; within 25% daily cap).**

This week's new-position count after fills: 3 — **weekly cap reached; no new names until week of May 25.**

1. **BUY AVGO 20 shares** (est. ~$8,285 at ~$414)
   *Thesis:* AI networking and custom silicon leadership; Broadcom's hyperscaler custom ASIC
   contracts are multi-year structural wins; CEO projects $100B+ in custom AI chip revenue by
   end of 2027; Wells Fargo target $545, Evercore target $582; Meta 2nm chip partnership new
   catalyst; 28 analysts Strong Buy; not overextended. 8.3% of portfolio starter.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* major hyperscaler capex cut guidance; loss of key custom silicon customer; AVGO
   breaks below $370 on volume.

2. **BUY MSFT 20 shares** (est. ~$8,380 at ~$419)
   *Thesis:* Azure AI growing 40% with accelerating AI revenue; Copilot embedding into 300M+
   enterprise seats creates durable compounding revenue floor; EY $1B+ alliance signals enterprise
   adoption inflecting; down 12% YTD provides improving entry vs. quality FCF profile; defensive
   if macro softens. 8.4% of portfolio starter.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* Azure growth decelerates below 30%; enterprise AI adoption stalls; MSFT breaks
   below $375 on volume.

3. **BUY AMZN 30 shares** (est. ~$8,055 at ~$268.50)
   *Thesis:* AWS is the largest cloud/AI infrastructure platform with $244B committed backlog
   growing 40% YoY; Q1 2026 AWS revenue $37.6B (+28% YoY, fastest in 15 quarters) confirms
   acceleration; retail gaining market share from cost-conscious consumers; improving operating
   margins; Trainium AI chip competitive moat; 57/60 analysts buy; avg target $312 (+16% upside).
   8.1% of portfolio starter.
   *Stop:* 10% trailing stop immediately after fill.
   *Invalidation:* AWS growth decelerates sharply; AMZN breaks below $240 on volume.

**Post-fill cash:** ~$75,300 (75.3%) — well above 5% minimum.

**Contingency:** If SPY opens down >1% from yesterday's close (i.e., opens below $735), reduce
each order by ~25% (AVGO 15sh, MSFT 15sh, AMZN 22sh). The Iran "final stages" narrative may
shift quickly — monitor overnight before the open.

**Treasury yield watch:** 10yr at 4.67%, 30yr at 5.2%. If 10yr crosses 4.75% intraday, tighten
stops and do not add to positions. These yields are real multiple-compression risks. Our 75% cash
reserve post-fills is by design.

## 2026-05-21 — Pre-market research (late run, ~13:40 ET; market was open)

> **Note:** This pre-market routine ran during market hours. No trades placed
> today. The plan below targets **Friday May 22, 2026 market open**.

### Macro

- **S&P 500 today:** −0.45% (SPY $742.69, up +0.44% from inception $739.44).
  Nasdaq −0.50%, Russell 2000 +2.56% (small-cap rotation).
- **Iran conflict — dominant macro risk:** Iran Supreme Leader issued directive
  on uranium (new escalation signal). The broader 2026 Iran war has caused the
  largest oil supply disruption in history (Strait of Hormuz closure). Brent
  crude jumped 15% to ~$83/barrel by March 2026.
- **CPI March 2026:** 3.3% YoY (up from 2.4% in Feb). Gasoline +21.2% MoM.
  Stagflation risk is real — Fed cannot cut in this environment.
- **Fed:** Funds rate 3.5–3.75%, on hold with hawkish lean. No cuts expected
  near-term given elevated CPI and energy shock.
- **Jobs:** April payrolls +115K (soft vs. prior months); unemployment ~4.3%.
- **Q1 S&P 500 blended margin:** 13.4% — highest FactSet has recorded since
  2009. Earnings fundamentals are still strong despite macro headwinds.
- **WMT:** Fell ~7% today ($121.78) after weak full-year guidance citing fuel
  cost absorption from Iran conflict. Consumer defensives are NOT immune.

### Held positions

None — portfolio is 100% cash since inception (May 21).

### Watchlist / candidate review

| Ticker | Price today | Prev close | Change | Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|-------|
| AVGO | $414.26 | $417.51 | −0.8% | AI custom silicon. CEO: $100B+ revenue by 2027. 28 analysts Strong Buy, avg target $451.89. UBS $490. Thesis intact. |
| MSFT | $418.05 | $421.08 | −0.7% | Q3 FY2026: EPS $4.27 beat ($4.06 est), Azure +40%, AI revenue $37B (+123% YoY). Down 12% YTD — entry improving. OpenAI rev-share ended (any cloud can now serve OpenAI models). Capex raised to $190B. |
| AMZN | $268.22 | $265.00 | +1.2% | AWS backlog $244B (+40% YoY). 95% analyst buy/strong-buy consensus. Avg target $319. Strong on fundamentals despite Iran macro. |
| NVDA | $221.52 | $223.48 | −0.9% | Q1 FY27 earnings beat: revenue $81.62B (+85% YoY), data center doubled to $75.2B. Q2 guidance $91B. Stock reaction muted — market digesting. Monitor for pullback entry next week. |
| META | $607.15 | $604.98 | +0.4% | Q1 revenue $56.3B (+33% YoY), beat by $900M. 2026 capex raised to $125-145B — creates near-term overhang. Analyst avg target $828 (35% upside). On watchlist; not adding yet. |
| LLY | $1,039.22 | $1,018.42 | +2.0% | GLP-1 dominance, Q1 revenue +56% YoY. Strong but at $1,039/share sizing is awkward. Watchlist. |
| LRCX | $301.02 | $292.21 | +3.0% | Continued post-earnings momentum. Avoid chasing (+3% today, +6.8% yesterday). Watch for pullback. |
| WMT | $121.78 | $130.93 | −7.0% | **DO NOT BUY.** Full-year guidance cut on Iran fuel cost absorption. Thesis broken for consumer defensive play. Removed from near-term consideration. |
| XOM | $154.60 | $156.30 | −1.1% | Energy facing Iran-related moves but pulled back after prior surge. No catalyst for immediate entry. Watchlist. |

### Market posture

Cautiously constructive. AI infrastructure spend is structural and accelerating
(NVDA data center doubled, MSFT Azure +40%, AWS backlog +40%). However, the
Iran oil shock introduces a genuine stagflation risk: higher energy prices →
higher CPI → Fed on hold longer → P/E multiple compression risk across the
market. WMT's 7% drop today is a canary — cost pressures are real.

Strategy: Build the portfolio **gradually** with high-conviction AI
infrastructure names at starter sizing. Hold ≥75% cash until macro picture
(Iran situation, CPI trajectory) becomes clearer. No consumer names for now.

---

### Planned trades for Friday May 22, 2026 open

**Three starter positions — total deployment ~$24,680 (~24.7% of portfolio; within 25% daily cap).**

This brings this week's new-position count to 3 (weekly cap reached after these
fills — no new positions until the week of May 25).

1. **BUY AVGO 20 shares** (~$8,285 at ~$414)
   *Thesis:* AI networking and custom silicon leadership; Broadcom's hyperscaler
   custom ASIC contracts are multi-year structural wins; CEO projects $100B+ in
   custom AI chip revenue by end of 2027; 28 analysts Strong Buy; avg target
   $451 (+9% upside); not overextended. 8.3% of portfolio starter.

2. **BUY MSFT 20 shares** (~$8,360 at ~$418)
   *Thesis:* Azure AI growing 40% with $37B annualized AI revenue (+123% YoY);
   Copilot embedding into dominant enterprise install base creates durable
   revenue floor; down 12% YTD provides an improving entry vs. quality FCF
   profile; defensive if macro softens. 8.4% of portfolio starter.

3. **BUY AMZN 30 shares** (~$8,040 at ~$268)
   *Thesis:* AWS is the largest cloud/AI infrastructure platform with $244B
   committed backlog growing 40% YoY; retail gaining market share from
   cost-conscious consumers; improving operating margins; 95% analyst
   buy/strong-buy consensus with avg target $319 (+19% upside). 8.0% starter.

All three receive 10% trailing-stop orders immediately after fills.
Cash after buys: ~$75,320 (75.3%) — well above 5% minimum.

**Contingency:** If SPY opens down >1% Friday due to further Iran escalation,
reduce each order by ~25% (e.g., AVGO 15sh, MSFT 15sh, AMZN 22sh) and hold
the remaining allocation for the following week.

---

## 2026-05-21 (evening) — NOTE: the plan below was NOT executed

A routine git-sync bug pushed each run's work to a throwaway branch instead of
`main`, so the market-open routine never saw the plan below and placed no
trades. The bug is now fixed. The portfolio is still 100% cash. The 5/21 plan
is **expired** (the open has passed) — the next pre-market run should research
and plan fresh from current prices.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Pre-market research (INCEPTION RUN)

**Macro:**
- S&P 500 at all-time highs; SPY $739.44 pre-market (+0.8% from prev close $733.80).
- Fed funds rate: 3.5–3.75% — held at April 2026 FOMC meeting for third consecutive pause.
  Four dissenters (most since 1992), with Governor Miran voting to cut 25 bps; Fed
  language signals patience citing sticky inflation and elevated Middle East risk.
- Q1 2026 real GDP growth: +2.0% annualized (strong acceleration from Q4 2025's +0.5%).
- Unemployment: 4.3%; 178K payrolls added in March.
- S&P 500 forward P/E: ~20.9x — above 10-year avg of 18.9x; earnings growth (~15–28% YoY) is
  the justification; valuations not cheap but supported by fundamentals.
- Sector rotation underway: industrials (+16%), energy (+22%), and consumer defensives (+13%)
  are outperforming, offsetting some pure-tech froth.
- Middle East tensions adding macro uncertainty; energy prices elevated.

**Held names:** None (inception run — all cash).

**Watchlist / candidates reviewed:**
- **AVGO** $416.34 (+1.3%): AI networking & custom silicon. "Strong Buy" from 46 analysts,
  avg 12-month target $477.59; UBS at $490, Evercore at $582. Clean setup.
- **MSFT** $419.93 (+0.6%): Enterprise AI compounder. Azure + Copilot embedded in enterprise.
  Defensive earnings profile, strong FCF. Reasonable setup vs. peers.
- **AMZN** $265.00 (+2.2%): AWS AI infrastructure + retail. Market-share gains in cloud and
  cost-conscious consumer spend tailwind. Better risk/reward than NVDA post-earnings.
- **LLY** $1,018.42 (−0.3%): Eli Lilly — Q1 revenue +56% YoY; GLP-1 dominance. At $1,018,
  position sizing is awkward (10 shares = $10,184). Adding to watchlist; best entry if any
  one-day weakness. Will plan for next week.
- **LRCX** $292.21 (+6.8%): Large single-day pop (possibly earnings-related). Avoid chasing;
  add to watchlist for pullback entry.
- **XOM** $156.29 (−3.9%): Notable pullback from $162.61. Worth watching; could be entry if
  oil stabilizes, but no catalyst today.
- **WMT** $130.93 (−2.5%): Pullback from $134.24. Consumer defensive with AI supply-chain
  tailwinds. Watching for stabilization before entry.
- **META** $604.98 (+0.4%): Steady. Good FCF profile, AI ad-targeting flywheel. Watchlist.
- **NVDA**: Just reported Q1 FY2027 earnings on 2026-05-20. Post-earnings dust settling.
  Will monitor and potentially buy on pullback after market digests.

**Market posture:** Constructive — strong earnings season, stable Fed, GDP accelerating.
Elevated valuations argue for selective entry, not broad buying. Start with 3 high-quality
AI infrastructure names at starter sizing. Build gradually per strategy cash policy.

---

### Planned trades for today

**Three starter positions — total deployment ~$24,600 (24.6% of portfolio; within 25% daily cap).**

1. **BUY AVGO ~20 shares** (~$8,327 at $416)
   Thesis: AI networking and custom silicon leadership; hyperscaler custom ASIC demand is
   multi-year; strong analyst support; not extended. 8.3% of portfolio starter.

2. **BUY MSFT ~20 shares** (~$8,400 at $420)
   Thesis: Azure AI + Copilot compounding into dominant enterprise install base; quality FCF
   compounder; defensive if macro softens; reasonable valuation vs. peers. 8.4% of portfolio.

3. **BUY AMZN ~30 shares** (~$7,950 at $265)
   Thesis: AWS is largest cloud/AI infrastructure platform; retail gaining market share from
   cost-conscious consumers; improving margins; dual growth engines. 7.95% of portfolio.
