⚠️ **trades.jsonl system defect flagged:** Only 2 records in JSONL (V buy and META stop_fill, both Jun 10) vs 5 closed trades in narrative ledger. Initial position buys (AVGO, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META) and their exit fills were never written to JSONL. The JSONL is materially incomplete. **closed-trades.md is the authoritative source for trade statistics until all future buys/sells are consistently logged to JSONL.** Future routines must write every fill to JSONL at execution time.

### Process audit

| Check | Result | Grade |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Cash drag (~75% vs 25–40% target) | Slot 3 LRCX unused — explicitly journaled justification (ATR ~10%, extended +19.5% in 6 sessions, Friday weekend risk). Not a passive default. | ✓ Justified |
| Sector caps | Healthcare 11.54%, Financials 7.18%, Energy 6.00% — all far below 60% cap | ✓ |
| Stop discipline | 4/4 stops confirmed at every session audit throughout the week | ✓ PERFECT |

| Written thesis at entry | VST: nuclear PPA + Helix thesis ✓; V: 5-of-5 entry signals ✓ | ✓ |
| Guardrail checks at every routine | All checks completed and logged | ✓ |

### What worked

- **VST Helix thesis upgrade (June 11):** KKR + NVIDIA + Kuwait Investment Authority launched Helix Digital Infrastructure — VST is the preferred power provider for a $10B+ AI infrastructure platform. Position held through June 10 crisis close ($138.54, $0.15 above −7% cut threshold) on intact thesis. Confirmed correct: VST recovered to $147.98 by Friday with a materially stronger thesis than at entry.
- **LLY continued to perform:** +4.10% from avg entry $1,093.53 EOD June 12. Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 approaching (19 days). Phase 2 trial expansions (chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis) announced — pipeline diversification positive. Stop HWM $1,182.73 provides 6.49% buffer.
- **V entry thesis confirmed:** 5-of-5 entry signals met. OpenAI partnership announced (AI agent-driven transactions), Payments Forum 2026 stablecoin/token capabilities confirmed. Essentially flat (−0.42%) in 3 sessions — within normal variance.
- **High-cash cushion on volatile week:** SPY fell −1.67% on June 10 (CPI 4.2% YoY + Iran/US military strikes). Bull at 75% cash fell only −0.30% that session — cash drag paid off as a protective buffer repeatedly this week.
- **META trailing stop executed correctly:** No manual intervention — rules-based exit at $578.00. Post-mortem completed. Lesson added. Clean process.
- **LRCX slot 3 discipline held all week:** Four consecutive justified deferrals (ATR ~10% each day). Deliberate, not passive.

### What didn't work

- **META stop-out at $578.00 (−6.87%):** Near-maximum realized loss. Stop at $578.142 and −7% rule at $577.19 were co-located — as warned in Week 3 review. The June 10 broad-market shock (CPI hot, Iran strikes, VIX +12%) triggered the exit. $639.56 realized loss. Entry into a macro inflection with a high-beta name remains the system's biggest flaw.
- **Bull lagged SPY by 0.81pp this week:** Primarily cash drag (75% cash in a week where SPY gained +0.58%) amplified by the META $639 realized loss.
- **VST near-miss:** June 10 close $138.54 vs −7% threshold $138.39 = $0.15 of cushion. One bad close away from a forced exit. The thesis was correct to hold — but the position sizing (started at 6%) and entry price ($148.81 on a stock that promptly fell 7%) were cutting it close.
- **Open positions all slightly underwater at EOD:** LLY +4.10% but V −0.42% and VST −0.56%. Portfolio net unrealized P/L ≈ +$326.

### Macro context (week of June 8–12, 2026)

- **Iran/US peace deal:** Draft agreement advancing — US to lift oil sanctions, Iran to reopen Strait of Hormuz within 30 days. WTI fell to ~$85/bbl. Market rallied broadly on de-escalation. Oil below $100 trigger ✓.
- **FOMC June 16–17 (next week):** 89% probability of rate hold. Possible hawkish bias shift given CPI 4.2% YoY and NFP 172K (strong). If Fed signals no cuts and hints at hikes, 10yr could spike above 4.75% trigger. No new positions until Wednesday afternoon post-FOMC.
- **SpaceX SPCX IPO June 12:** Opened at $135, surged ~19% to $161 — largest IPO in history ($1.77T). Absorbed tech capital → Nasdaq 100 −0.5% vs S&P 500 +0.34%. Explains LLY −1.95% intraday despite intact thesis.
- **10yr yield:** ~4.47% — below 4.75% watch trigger ✓.

### Aggressive Bull lesson (section 7b)

**AGGRO performance (EOD June 12):**
- AGGRO since inception (June 4): **−5.95%** ($94,051.73)
- SPY since AGGRO inception: **−1.65%** ($754.18 → $741.75)
- AGGRO alpha: **−4.30pp** vs SPY

**Cautious Bull since AGGRO inception (June 4):**
- Bull June 4 EOD: $99,820.82 → June 12 EOD: $98,696.00 = **−1.13%**
- Cautious Bull leads AGGRO by **+4.82pp** since June 4.

**Key AGGRO lesson this week:** AGGRO's wider 18% trailing stops kept all positions alive through the volatile week, but META is now at −9.88% (only 2.12pp from the −12% forced cut) — far worse than Cautious Bull's −6.87% exit. Cautious Bull's 10% stop on META was the **correct** choice: it limited the loss to −6.87% vs AGGRO sitting on a live −9.88% position that could deteriorate further. Wider stops are not always better; in a volatile macro environment with a macro-inflection thesis, tighter stops protect against larger structural drawdowns.

AGGRO's 77% tech concentration (NVDA+META+AVGO+MSFT+AMZN+GOOGL) amplified every sector selloff. Cautious Bull's diversification (LLY healthcare, V financials, VST energy) provided meaningfully lower sector correlation and less drawdown.

**No rule change proposed** (AGGRO is not outperforming; it is underperforming by 4.82pp). AGGRO's approach is performing as designed — high-conviction concentration means higher upside potential in a sustained trend but larger drawdowns in volatile markets. No lesson requires a rule change; the existing 10% stop + diversification approach is proven correct this week.

**Cross-Bull learning counter:** AGGRO TRAILS Cautious by 4.82pp since AGGRO inception. Trigger condition (AGGRO beats Cautious by >5pp for 2 consecutive weeks) is **NOT MET**. Counter = 0. No change to `memory/control.md` CROSS_BULL_LEARNING line.

### Strategy adjustments for week of June 16+

1. **FOMC gate:** No new positions before Wednesday June 18 afternoon unless the entry signal is exceptional (all 5-of-5 criteria met, low-ATR name). FOMC could shift bias hawkish — risk of 10yr crossing 4.75% trigger. After FOMC, reassess with rate outlook confirmed.
2. **LRCX re-evaluation:** Cantor Fitzgerald raised PT to $425 June 10. The stock is consolidating after a +19.5% run. Conditions for entry: (a) ATR normalizes to ≤3% (need 3+ quiet sessions), (b) stock closes 2+ sessions in a tight range on contracting volume, (c) price not extended >10% above 50-day SMA. Check pre-market Monday June 16 — if all three met, Slot 1.
3. **VST dividend ex-date June 22:** 10 days away. USD 9.20 credit (40sh × $0.23). Confirm stop ratchets above ex-div adjusted price after June 22.
4. **LLY review_by July 1** (Medicare GLP-1 Bridge effective date): Must make explicit hold/trim/exit decision at pre-market June 30 or July 1 based on bridge implementation data.
5. **NVDA re-entry eligibility:** Senate Banking hearing passed without CEO Huang testimony. Regulatory overhang somewhat reduced. Re-evaluate for June 16+ entry if NVDA shows basing above $205 with normalizing ATR.

## Week ending 2026-06-05 (Week 3 — 5 active trading days: Mon Jun 1 – Fri Jun 5)

- **Bull return (week):** −2.32% ($101,263.22 → $98,916.92)
- **SPY return (week):** −2.52% ($756.65 → $737.55)
- **Result:** Beat SPY by **+0.20%** — first outperformance in a down week
- **Since inception (2026-05-21):** Bull −1.08% vs SPY −0.26% = **−0.82% gap**
- **Grade:** B−

**What worked:**
- **High-cash position (79%) as shock absorber.** SPY fell −2.52% on the week, with a −2.41% free-fall on Friday alone (strong NFP pushed rate-cut expectations out). Bull fell only −2.32% on the week and only −0.97% on Friday. The build-phase cash posture delivered its clearest demonstration of value since inception.
- **LLY is the portfolio's standout.** Thesis triple-confirmed this week: CVS June 5 positive news, Medicare GLP-1 Bridge July 1 effective, Q1 revenue +56% YoY. Scale-up from 7sh to 10sh (avg entry $1,093.534) was well-timed on fundamental confirmation — adding to a winner, not chasing. Current +3.69% from avg entry.
- **All 4 exits via guardrails, zero discretionary panic.** AMZN (−7% rule, Jun 3), AVGO (trailing stop gap-fill, Jun 4), NVDA (trailing stop, Jun 5 ~11:20 AM), MSFT (trailing stop, Jun 5 ~12:08 PM). The system worked as designed — no manual second-guessing.
- **NVDA and MSFT stops triggering mid-session prevented afternoon continuation losses.** Both stocks fell further in the afternoon after the stops fired; the early exits were better than holding through the close.
- **Visa (Slot 3) correctly deferred.** CFO insider selling of >50% warrants more research — the discipline of not forcing a trade was correct.

**What didn't work:**
- **AVGO gap-down earnings (-14.9%) wiped a paper gain of +17%.** The trailing stop could not protect against the overnight gap (stop was $445.50; stock opened ~$409). Net realized P/L from entry: −$175 (−2.1%) — a disappointing result for the portfolio's largest initial winner. The gap risk was known but the magnitude was not. The lesson from the prior week about the $10.7B guide threshold was well-applied; the gap risk itself is structural and cannot be fully avoided.
- **META entered June 1 into a macro reversal.** All 5 entry signals were met, but the stock dropped −4.69% from entry ($620.637 → $591.51 Jun 5 EOD) — primarily macro-driven (SPY −2.52% week). Stop is at $578.142 with only $13.37 buffer (2.26%) going into Monday. The AI ad thesis remains intact, but the position is on life support.
- **NVDA never recovered above entry after AVGO sympathy selling.** Entered at $216.302; best close during the week was $222.694 (Jun 1). The Senate Banking Committee hearing (June 11) added regulatory overhang that kept the stock subdued. Stopped out at $209.042 (−3.36%). Entry timing was poor — AVGO gap risk was known to create sympathy pressure the day NVDA was held.
- **Portfolio shrank from 6 positions to 2.** Starting the week with 5 inherited positions plus 1 new entry (META), we end with 2 (LLY + META, and META is at risk). Capital preservation is correct, but rebuilding with conviction takes time.
- **Since-inception gap is −0.82%.** Three weeks in, we lag SPY by 82 basis points. Almost entirely explained by cash drag while SPY rallied in weeks 1–2, then realized losses this week from AMZN, NVDA, MSFT, AVGO exits.

**Strategy adjustments (applied where noted):**
- **META Monday morning (June 8):** If META opens below $582, treat as HIGHEST ALERT. The stop at $578.142 and the −7% cut at $577.19 are essentially co-located. Even if the AI ad thesis is intact, the price action requires respect. Do not hold through a thesis break.
- **Rebuild portfolio gradually (week of June 8):** 3 new-position slots available. Primary research: V (Visa, Slot 1 — resolve CFO selling concern), LRCX (semi equipment, AI fab wave, Slot 2), and one more. Do NOT rush to fill all 3 slots — only trade with high conviction.
- **Earnings gap-down protocol (added to strategy.md):** When holding a position into earnings, the +15% tighten rule is correctly waived. However, the scale-up plan must always require positive market reaction on the day (not just literal trigger satisfaction). For future earnings plays: if stock gaps down >8% on earnings, do NOT add even if AI-revenue threshold technically met. Exit gracefully via trailing stop. No scale-up into a falling knife.
- **Consider energy/utility as portfolio diversifier:** Aggro Bull's VST position (nuclear, data-center PPAs with Meta and AWS) is an interesting non-correlated idea. Research VST for Cautious Bull's universe — adds sector balance and is not correlated with AI semi selloffs.

## Week ending 2026-05-29 (Week 2 — 4 active trading days: Tue May 26 – Fri May 29)

- **Bull return (week):** +1.49% ($99,776.38 → $101,263.22)
- **SPY return (week):** +1.47% ($745.67 → $756.65)
- **Result:** Essentially tied — Bull ahead by +0.02% (first week Bull has matched SPY)
- **Since inception (May 21):** Bull +1.26% vs SPY +2.33% = **−1.07% gap** (improved from −1.34% last week)
- **Grade:** B+

**What worked:**
- **AVGO** (+7.35% this week, +6.44% from entry) — biggest weekly contributor. Analyst upgrades (Citi $500, Susquehanna $490) corroborated the AI custom silicon thesis. HWM ratcheted to ~$444.71, stop now ~$400.24. June 3 earnings are the next major catalyst.
- **MSFT** (+6.90% this week, +6.17% from entry) — six consecutive strong sessions. Azure AI thesis fully intact. HWM ratcheted to ~$446.27, stop ~$401.64. Pershing Square endorsement adds high-profile validation.
- **LLY** (+3.19% from May 26 entry) — thesis is the strongest in the portfolio. CVS announced Foundayo coverage June 1 + Zepbound coverage Oct 1 (major commercial access win). Bernstein conference May 28 was positive. GLP-1 market share 60.1%.
- **MRVL skip was correct.** EPS $0.80 missed $0.85 strong-beat threshold; revenue $2.418B missed $2.5B threshold. Pre-market fade from $215→$200 confirmed market was pricing perfection. Avoiding the rug-pull was the right call.
- **COST skip was correct.** EPS $4.93 missed $5.10 threshold; revenue $70.53B missed $71B threshold; worldwide renewal 89.7% missed >90%. AH reaction minimal — market confirmed the print was uninspiring. Third slot correctly carried to week of June 1.
- **Macro reads all correct:** Core PCE came in benign (0.2% MoM, 3.3% YoY — well below 0.35% tightening trigger); WTI fell to $87.66 on Iran deal progress (below $100 watch); Goldman raised S&P 500 target to 8,000. No defensive pivot needed.
- **Process discipline excellent:** No forced trades, written theses for all entries, guardrails maintained throughout.

**What didn't work:**
- **NVDA** (−1.78% from May 26 entry) — softest name in the portfolio. Bought at $216.30, now $212.45. AI accelerator monopoly thesis intact but stock is underperforming the broader AI rally. Well above stop ($196.36) but bears watching.
- **AMZN** (+0.56% from entry, +1.09% this week) — muted relative to AVGO/MSFT. AWS $364B backlog thesis intact but stock lagging peers. HWM $274.37, stop $246.93.
- **Cash drag (60.4%)** remains the primary structural lag since inception. The −1.07% gap vs SPY is almost entirely explained by holding 60% in cash while SPY rose 2.33% from inception. This is correct portfolio construction for an early-stage build, but it is a real cost.
- **Third weekly slot unused.** MRVL and COST were both correctly skipped, but the result is one fewer position compounding returns. The carried slot will be deployed in the week of June 1.

**Strategy adjustments (applied where noted):**
- **Week of June 1 priority:** Deploy the 1 carried position slot. Primary candidate: **META** (ad-tech AI flywheel, strong FCF, ~$607). Secondary: **LLY scale-up** if CVS Foundayo June 1 coverage drives positive momentum. Do NOT rush — wait for AVGO earnings June 3 before adding more AI-semi concentration.
- **AVGO June 3 earnings plan:** Do NOT add before the print. If strong beat + raised guidance → scale to 12-15% in the session following the print. Defined threshold: AI revenue guidance raised materially, hyperscaler custom ASIC commentary positive. If miss → protect via existing stop; do not add.
- **NVDA review trigger:** If NVDA fails to participate in any June AI rally following AVGO's earnings (i.e., remains below entry at the June 6 close), conduct a full thesis review at the next weekly review. Stop at $196.36 gives adequate room; no action now.
- **Cash deployment path:** Target 6–8 positions with 20–30% cash by end of June. Currently 5 positions, 60% cash. Systematic deployment — 1 new position per week — keeps us within weekly caps while reducing structural lag.
- **S&P 500 9th consecutive weekly gain confirmed** (per market data). Market is broadly bullish. No defensive rotation warranted. Maintain pro-cyclical, AI-infrastructure tilt.

## Week ending 2026-05-22 (Inception week — 2 active trading days)

- **Bull return (week / since inception):** −0.22% ($100,000.00 → $99,775.58)
- **SPY return (week, since inception anchor $739.44):** +0.84% ($739.44 → $745.67)
- **SPY full-week context:** SPY had a strong recovery week; ATH was $748.17 on May 14, pulled back hard May 15 ("deep in the red"), bottomed ~$733.80 on May 20, then recovered to close the week at $745.67. Bull launched on May 21 (Thursday), right after the pullback trough — a reasonable entry timing but only 2 days of market exposure.
- **Result:** Lagged SPY by −1.06% since inception
- **Grade:** B

**What worked:**
- Pre-market research was thorough and well-documented on both May 21 and May 22; full written theses drafted for each position before execution, satisfying the knowledge-base standard
- Three starter positions opened May 22 within all guardrails: AVGO 20sh (8.3%), MSFT 20sh (8.4%), AMZN 30sh (8.0%) — total deployment 24.7%, just inside the 25% daily cap
- 10% trailing-stop orders placed and verified on all three positions immediately after fills
- Midday check performed; all three positions at −0.52% to −0.84%, well above the −7% cut threshold; no unnecessary action taken
- Cash at 75.3% — far above the 5% hard minimum; intentional risk buffer given elevated yields and Iran macro uncertainty
- Weekly 3-new-positions cap fully and correctly used; count resets week of May 26
- Git infrastructure bug (pushes landing on throwaway branch instead of main) identified and fixed after the May 21 run; system continuity restored

**What didn't work:**
- May 21 pre-market routine ran at ~1:40 PM ET instead of 8:00 AM ET — too late to execute same-day trades; the entire May 21 trading session was lost. SPY rose +0.44% on May 21 while Bull sat 100% in cash
- Git push bug on day 1 meant the May 21 market-open routine never received the trade plan — cost the portfolio a direct trading-day opportunity as well as amplifying the since-inception underperformance vs. SPY
- All three initial positions opened on May 22 closed the week slightly below entry (AVGO −1.0%, MSFT −0.7%, AMZN −1.0%); likely entered on intraday strength in the first minutes after the open; a brief pause or limit order approach could have improved fills
- As a 75%-cash portfolio, Bull mechanically underperforms a rising market — this is by design for an early-stage build, but it is the primary structural drag this week

**Strategy adjustments:**
- No changes to core strategy or position theses; all three positions remain valid with catalysts intact; well above stop levels
- **Watchlist additions for next week:** NVDA (pullback entry if it consolidates below $220 on low volume; AI momentum is the strongest in the market); LLY (GLP-1 secular growth, but sizing is awkward at ~$1,039/sh — use a notional target of ~$8,000 = ~7-8 shares)
- **Macro watch:** 10yr yield at 4.67%, 30yr at 5.2% are real multiple-compression risks for the AI names held; if 10yr crosses 4.75% on an upward trend, no new buys and consider tightening stops on AVGO and MSFT
- **Iran / Memorial Day note:** Market closed May 25 (Memorial Day); next routine is pre-market Tuesday May 26; use the long weekend to reassess Iran situation and yield trajectory before deploying more capital
- **Lesson applied:** Pre-market routine MUST run at 8:00 AM ET. A late run wastes the trading day — see lessons.md
